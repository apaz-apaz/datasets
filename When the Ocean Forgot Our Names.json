      "content": "The turtle opened one old eye.\n\n“I am tired,” it said. “I have carried your names for a thousand years. My shell is full. I want to rest.”\n\nLulu touched the shell gently.\n\n“If you forget us, we disappear,” she said.\n\nThe turtle sighed. “Then teach me new names. Light ones. Happy ones. So I can carry them forever.”"

The ocean knows your name already!”\n\nThe end.\n\n![Happy village dancing as waves return](https://picsum.photos/seed/happy-village-waves/800/600)"
