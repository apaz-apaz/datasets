It is used in business, economics, and resource management.\n\n---\n### 1. Key Concepts\n- **Decision Variables:** Unknowns to determine (e.g., x, y)\n- **Objective Function:** Linear function to maximize/minimize (e.g., Z = 3x + 2y)\n- **Constraints:** Linear inequalities limiting the variables\n- **Feasible Region:** Set of all points satisfying constraints\n- **Corner Points:** Vertices of feasible region\n- **Optimal Solution:** Point giving maximum or minimum value of objective function\n\n---\n### 2. Steps to Solve LP Problem\n1. Define **decision variables**\n2. Formulate **objective function**\n3. Write **constraints** as linear inequalities\n4. Draw **graph of constraints**\n5. Identify **feasible region**\n6. Find **corner points**\n7. Evaluate **objective function at corner points**\n8. Select **point giving maximum/minimum**\n\n---\n### 3. Worked Examples\n#### Example 1: Maximization with Two Constraints\n**Problem:** Maximize Z = 3x + 4y\nConstraints:\n- x + y ‚â§ 5\n- x ‚â§ 3\n- y ‚â§ 4\n- x ‚â• 0, y ‚â• 0\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Draw lines x+y=5, x=3, y=4 on graph in first quadrant\n2. Feasible region: Polygon with vertices (0,0), (0,4), (1,4), (3,2), (3,0)\n3. Evaluate Z at vertices:\n   - (0,0): Z=0\n   - (0,4): Z=16\n   - (1,4): Z=3*1 + 4*4 = 19\n   - (3,2): Z=3*3 + 4*2 = 17\n   - (3,0): Z=9\n4. Maximum Z=19 at (1,4)\n**Answer:** x=1, y=4, Zmax=19\n\n#### Example 2: Minimization Problem\n**Problem:** Minimize Z = 2x + 3y\nConstraints:\n- x + y ‚â• 4\n- x ‚â• 0, y ‚â• 0\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Line x+y=4 passes through (0,4) and (4,0)\n2. Feasible region: Above the line in first quadrant\n3. Corner points: (0,4), (4,0)\n4. Evaluate Z:\n   - (0,4): Z = 2*0 + 3*4 = 12\n   - (4,0): Z = 2*4 + 3*0 = 8\n5. Minimum Z = 8 at (4,0)\n**Answer:** x=4, y=0, Zmin=8\n\n#### Example 3: Special Cases\n1. **No feasible solution:** Constraints do not overlap\n2. **Unbounded feasible region:** Maximum or minimum does not exist (e.g., maximize Z=x+y with x‚â•0, y‚â•0, x+y‚â•1, no upper bound)\n3. **Multiple optimal solutions:** Z has same value along a line segment in feasible region\n\n---\n### 4. Summary\n- LP involves **decision variables, objective function, constraints, feasible region, corner points, and optimal solution**\n- **Graphical method** works for 2-variable problems\n- **Corner points evaluation** is key to find maximum or minimum\n- **Special cases** include unbounded region, no solution, and multiple optimal solutions\n- Worked examples provide **step-by-step understanding** of LP problems"
