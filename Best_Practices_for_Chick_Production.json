          "chapter_title": "Selection of Quality Eggs for Hatching",
          "content": "### Criteria for Selecting Eggs\n1. **Health of the parent stock:** Use eggs from healthy chickens free from diseases.\n2. **Age of the parent birds:** Ideal age for producing hatching eggs is 6–12 months.\n3. **Size and shape of the egg:** Eggs with good shape, proper shell quality, and suitable weight yield strong chicks.\n4. **Ready for incubation:** Avoid cracked, dirty, or deformed eggs.\n\n### Pre-Incubation Inspection\n- Perform **candling** (shine a light through the egg) to check for internal defects.\n- Choose eggs with **uniform color, firm yolk, and intact membranes**."

        "Incubation Methods": {
          "chapter_title": "Incubation Methods",
          "content": "### 1. Natural Incubation (Brooding by Hens)\n- Place eggs under a healthy, mature hen.\n- Ensure the **brooder is clean, spacious, and well-ventilated**.\n- Hens turn eggs daily to maintain even warmth.\n- Advantages: Low cost and promotes natural immunity in chicks.\n\n### 2. Artificial Incubation (Using Incubators)\n- Use an incubator maintaining **temperature of 37.5–38°C** and humidity 55–60%.\n- Turn eggs at least 3–5 times a day to prevent sticking.\n- Regularly monitor the incubator for proper function.\n- Advantages: Allows large-scale incubation and better control of outcomes.\n\n### Combined Approach\n- Many farmers use a mix: a few eggs under hens and the rest in incubators to maximize productivity."

          "chapter_title": "Brooding Chicks After Hatching",
          "content": "### Basic Requirements\n1. **Temperature:** Keep chicks at 32–35°C during the first week, gradually reducing over time.\n2. **Clean water:** Provide sufficient clean water daily.\n3. **Feed:** Start with starter feed containing 18–20% protein for week 0–8.\n4. **Hygiene:** Clean the brooder daily, removing droppings and leftover feed.\n\n### Health and Protection\n- Separate sick chicks immediately to prevent disease spread.\n- Watch for signs like loss of appetite, weakness, or unusual behavior.\n- Administer vaccines and preventive medications as outlined in vaccination schedules.\n\n### Growth Monitoring\n- Regularly check chick weight.\n- Record growth, behavior, and health to detect issues early.\n- Provide adequate light: 20 hours/day during week 1, then reduce to 16–18 hours/day."
