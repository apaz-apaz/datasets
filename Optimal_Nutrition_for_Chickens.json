        "Types of Feed for Chickens": {
          "chapter_title": "Types of Feed for Chickens",
          "content": "There are five main types of feed required by chickens:\n1. **Carbohydrates:** Maize, corn, barley, and rice. They provide energy for growth and bodily functions.\n2. **Proteins:** Fish meal, soybeans, beans, and peanuts. Proteins help muscle and tissue development.\n3. **Minerals:** Limestone, bone meal, and salt. They strengthen bones, produce strong eggshells, and support body functions.\n4. **Vitamins:** Leafy greens, vegetables, and fruits. They ensure proper growth and strong immunity.\n5. **Clean water:** Essential for life, digestion, and overall health."

        "Feed Combinations": {
          "chapter_title": "Feed Combinations",
          "content": "Feed should match the age of the chicken:\n- **Chicks (0–8 weeks):** Starter feed with 18–20% protein.\n- **Growing chickens (9–18 weeks):** Grower feed with 15–17% protein.\n- **Laying chickens (19+ weeks):** Layer feed rich in minerals, especially calcium.\n\n**Example of homemade feed mix:**\n- Chicks: 40 kg maize, 10 kg fish meal, 10 kg soybeans, 2 kg bone meal, 2 kg limestone, 200 g premix.\n- Growing chickens: 50 kg maize, 7 kg fish meal, 8 kg soybeans, 2 kg bone meal, 3 kg limestone, 200 g premix."

        "Natural and Commercial Feed": {
          "chapter_title": "Natural and Commercial Feed",
          "content": "Chickens can eat natural feeds like leaves, roots, and small insects. However, for commercial production, formulated feed ensures fast growth and high-quality eggs. The best approach is **a combination of both**, using natural feed to reduce costs and commercial feed to improve quality."

        "Water for Chickens": {
          "chapter_title": "Water for Chickens",
          "content": "Water is very important. Each chicken needs at least **200–300 ml per day**. Ensure water is clean, free from dust or contaminants, and replaced daily. Water aids digestion, nutrient absorption, and keeps chickens healthy."
