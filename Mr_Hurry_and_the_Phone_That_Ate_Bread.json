      "content": "In the small village of Mcheche, everyone knew one man: Bwana Haraka. He was called Haraka because he was always running. Running to work, running to church, running to the shop, running to the toilet. But somehow, he was still late for everything.\n\nOne day he bought the newest phone in Dar es Salaam – a shiny Samsung Galaxy Ultra Mega Plus. He loved it more than his own children. He even kissed it goodnight.\n\nLittle did he know… this phone had a very strange habit."

      "chapter_title": "The Day the Phone Discovered Chapati",
      "content": "Bwana Haraka woke up at 5:45 AM (which was sleeping in for him). He grabbed his fresh chapati from Mama Ntilie, put on his shoes, and ran out the door.\n\nWhile running to the daladala stand, he took out his new phone to check WhatsApp. The phone slipped, fell straight onto the chapati, and… CHOMP!\n\n![Shocked man watching his phone eat chapati](https://source.unsplash.com/800x600/?phone,food,funny)\n\nThe phone ate the entire chapati in 3 seconds flat.\n\nBwana Haraka screamed, 'Wewe! My breakfast!' The phone just showed a smiling emoji and said, 'Yummy' on the screen."

    "Chapter 2": {
      "chapter_title": "Breakfast Disaster at 200 km/h",
      "content": "The next morning, Bwana Haraka was smarter. He put the chapati in a plastic bag, tied it with seven knots, and held it in his teeth while running.\n\nHe took out the phone to take a selfie. The phone saw the chapati in his mouth and… ZOOM! It flew out of his hand, bit the chapati through the plastic, and swallowed everything – plastic, knots, and all.\n\nNow the phone started burping notifications: 'Burp… new message… burp… low battery.'\n\nThe whole daladala laughed until they cried."

      "chapter_title": "Mr Hurry vs Samsung – The Final Bite",
      "content": "Bwana Haraka decided enough was enough. That night he made 50 chapatis, stacked them like a tower, and left the phone on top.\n\n![Empty plate with phone crumbs](https://source.unsplash.com/800x600/?empty,plate,crumbs)\n\nIn the morning… the phone was gone. Only a thank-you note remained:\n'Thank you for the best week ever ❤️ Now I am fully charged for 10 years!'"

    "Conclusion": {
      "chapter_title": "The Moral of the Story",
      "content": "From that day, Bwana Haraka stopped running. He walks slowly now, eating his chapati peacefully before touching his phone.\n\nAnd somewhere in phone heaven, there is one very fat, very happy Samsung that never needs charging again.\n\nThe end.\n\n(But sometimes at night, people in Mcheche village still hear a quiet burp coming from the sky…)"
