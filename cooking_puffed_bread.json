Flip once → fry other side 10–15 seconds until golden\n7. Remove → drain on paper towel\n\nEvery single puri MUST puff – if not, your oil is not hot enough or dough is too soft.\n\nhttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1599921841143-819065a16493?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80\n*Perfect balloon-shaped puffed bread fresh from the oil*"
