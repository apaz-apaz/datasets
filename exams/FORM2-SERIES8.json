(a) [Diagram showing: nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, ribosomes, cell membrane, vacuole]\n\n   (b) Differences:\n       - Plant cells have a cell wall; animal cells do not.\n       - Plant cells have chloroplasts; animal cells do not.\n       - Plant cells have a large central vacuole; animal cells have small vacuoles.\n\n7. (a) Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight which provides energy for converting CO₂ and H₂O into glucose.\n\n   (b) 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂\n\n8. (a) Excretion is the removal of metabolic wastes. Importance: prevents accumulation of harmful substances, maintains homeostasis.\n\n   (b) Human excretory system: kidneys filter blood to form urine; lungs remove CO₂; skin excretes sweat.\n\n9. (a) Transport in animals is the movement of substances like oxygen, nutrients, and waste throughout the body.\n\n   (b) Blood circulates via the heart: arteries carry oxygenated blood to tissues, veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart, and capillaries facilitate exchange of substances.\n\n10. (a) Skeleton functions: support, protection, movement, blood cell formation, mineral storage.\n\n    (b) Hinge joints (elbow, knee) allow bending and straightening; ball-and-socket joints (hip, shoulder) allow rotation and multi-directional movement.\n\n11. (a) Experiment: Place a plant in a sealed container with sodium bicarbonate-free water (no CO₂). Cover one leaf with black paper. After exposure to sunlight, test leaves with iodine. Only leaves exposed to CO₂ turn blue-black, showing CO₂ is necessary.\n\n    (b) Leaves appear green because chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light and reflects green light.\n\n    (c) Factors affecting transpiration: temperature, wind, light intensity, humidity, water availability.\n"
