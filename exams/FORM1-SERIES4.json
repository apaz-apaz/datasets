C. kg/m³\n\nSubtotal: 20 marks\n\n### Section B: Short Answer Questions (40 Marks)\n\n21. (4 marks)\n Answers:\n - Scalar has magnitude only; vector has magnitude and direction\n - Scalar examples: mass, time; vector examples: force, velocity\n\n22. (3 marks)\n Answer: Density is mass per unit volume\n Unit: kg/m³\n\n23. (2 marks)\n Answer: °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9 → (100 - 32) × 5/9 = 37.78°C\n\n24. (3 marks)\n Answer: Density = mass / volume = 50 g / 20 cm³ = 2.5 g/cm³\n\n25. (3 marks)\n Answer: When a body is wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, the upthrust is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced\n\n26. (4 marks)\n Answer: Ship has large volume displacing a lot of water, so upthrust equals weight; steel is denser but shape allows more water displacement\n\n27. (4 marks)\n Answer: Pressure is force acting perpendicularly per unit area\n Unit: Pascal (Pa)\n\n28. (3 marks)\n Answer: Weight = m × g = 5 kg × 10 m/s² = 50 N\n\n29. (3 marks)\n Answers:\n - Nature of surfaces (rough/smooth)\n - Force pressing surfaces together\n - Area of contact\n\n30. (5 marks)\n Answer: Adhesion is attraction between molecules of different substances\n Example: Water sticks to glass surface making it wet\n\nSubtotal: 40 marks\n\n### Section C: Structured/Essay Questions (40 Marks)\n(Answer any two – 20 marks each)\n\n31. Full Answer:\n (a) Matter consists of tiny particles in constant random motion; motion increases with temperature; particles attract each other with varying strengths in different states\n (b) At 4°C to 0°C, water expands (anomalous expansion), so ice is less dense than water and floats\n (c) Surface tension is cohesive force making liquid surface behave like a stretched membrane\n Examples: Water droplets spherical; insects walk on water\n (d) Weigh empty bottle (m₁), fill with water (m₂), fill with liquid (m₃); density = (m₃ - m₁)/(m₂ - m₁) × density of water\n\n32. Full Answer:\n (a) Close jaws inside pipe, turn thimble until contact, read main scale + vernier coincidence\n (b) Mass of water = 80 g - 30 g = 50 g\n Volume = 50 cm³\n Mass of alcohol = 70 g - 30 g = 40 g\n Density = 40 g / 50 cm³ = 0.8 g/cm³\n (c) Precautions:\n - Avoid parallax error\n - Correct zero error\n - Do not overtighten spindle\n\n33. Full Answer:\n (a) A floating body displaces fluid equal to its own weight\n (b) Helium density less than air, so upthrust > weight of balloon and contents, causing it to rise\n (c) Use syringes connected by tube filled with water; apply force on small piston → observe larger piston moves with greater force\n (d) Applications:\n - Brakes in vehicles\n - Walking without slipping\n - Holding objects\n\nGrand Total: 100 marks"
