      "content": "**Total: 100 Marks**\n\n### Section A: Multiple Choice (20 Marks)\n(1 mark for each correct answer)\n\n1. **C. Thermodynamics** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Thermodynamics focuses on heat transfer, temperature, and energy changes in systems, distinct from other branches like optics (light) or mechanics (motion).\n\n2. **B. Atom** \n **Detailed Explanation**: An atom is the basic building block of elements, containing protons, neutrons, and electrons, retaining chemical properties.\n\n3. **B. Newton** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Force is measured in Newtons (N), defined as the force that causes a 1 kg mass to accelerate at 1 m/s².\n\n4. **C. Velocity** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Vectors have both magnitude and direction; velocity includes direction, unlike speed (scalar).\n\n5. **A. Depth, density, and gravity** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Liquid pressure formula P = ρgh shows dependence on density (ρ), depth (h), and gravitational acceleration (g).\n\n6. **C. Less than the liquid's density** \n **Detailed Explanation**: For floating, upthrust equals weight; lower density means less mass per volume, allowing displacement of sufficient fluid.\n\n7. **B. Capillarity** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Capillarity results from surface tension and adhesive/cohesive forces in narrow tubes.\n\n8. **A. Load** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Hooke's law: extension ∝ applied force (load) within elastic limit.\n\n9. **B. Barometer** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Barometers measure air pressure using mercury or aneroid mechanisms.\n\n10. **B. No units** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Relative density is a ratio of two densities, so units cancel out.\n\n11. **C. Second** \n **Detailed Explanation**: The second is the SI base unit for time.\n\n12. **C. Viscous drag** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Drag opposes motion through fluids (air or liquid), increasing with speed.\n\n13. **C. Low center of gravity and wide base** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Lower CG and wider base make it harder to topple, improving stability.\n\n14. **C. Solids** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Strong cohesive forces hold particles tightly in fixed positions in solids.\n\n15. **B. 0.01 mm** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Standard micrometer accuracy is 0.01 mm via vernier scale on the thimble.\n\n16. **B. Pascal's principle** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Pressure transmitted equally in confined fluids enables hydraulic brakes to multiply force.\n\n17. **C. Increases** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Gas particles gain kinetic energy with temperature, expanding volume (Charles's law).\n\n18. **C. Joule** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Joule is the SI unit for all forms of energy.\n\n19. **D. All of the above** \n **Detailed Explanation**: State changes (melting, boiling) involve temperature, pressure, or both.\n\n20. **C. Subtracted** \n **Detailed Explanation**: Zero error correction ensures accurate readings by subtracting systematic bias.\n\n**Subtotal: 20 marks**\n\n### Section B: Short Answer Questions (40 Marks)\n\n21.

(3 marks) \n **Answer**: Extension ∝ load/force within **elastic limit**. \n **Detailed Explanation**: Beyond elastic limit, material deforms permanently.\n\n26. (4 marks) \n **Answer**: Weight: gravitational pull (downward); Upthrust: buoyant force (upward by fluid). \n **Detailed Explanation**: Upthrust opposes weight, reducing apparent weight in fluids.\n\n27. (4 marks) \n **Answer**: Surface tension creates a 'skin' strong enough to support light needle if placed gently. \n **Detailed Explanation**: Cohesive forces between water molecules resist breaking.\n\n28. (3 marks) \n **Answer**: Upthrust = weight in air - apparent weight = 50 N - 30 N = **20 N**. \n **Detailed Explanation**: Loss in weight equals upthrust per Archimedes.\n\n29. (4 marks) \n **Answer**: Rise/fall of liquid in narrow tube due to adhesion/cohesion. Examples: water in plants, ink in pen. \n **Detailed Explanation**: Adhesion > cohesion causes rise in water; opposite in mercury.\n\n30.
