(3 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - **Mass** is constant; **weight** changes with location.\n - **Mass** is measured in kg; **weight** in N.\n - **Mass** is scalar; **weight** is vector.\n\n23.

(4 marks)\n **Answer**: A floating object displaces a weight of fluid equal to its own weight.\n\n26. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Ship has **large volume** and **hollow structure**, displacing a large weight of water greater than its own weight → floats. Needle has **small volume**, displaces little water → weight > upthrust → sinks.\n\n27. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Pressure is **force acting perpendicularly per unit area**.\n Formula: **P = F / A**\n\n28. (3 marks)\n **Answer**:\n Upthrust = weight in air - apparent weight in water = **30 N - 20 N = 10 N**\n\n29. (3 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - Use lubricants\n - Use ball bearings/rollers\n - Streamline shapes (reduce air friction)\n\n30. (5 marks)\n **Answer**: Elasticity is the property of a material to return to its original shape and size after removing the deforming force.\n Example: **Rubber band or spring** stretches when pulled but regains shape when released (within elastic limit).\n\n**Subtotal: 40 marks**\n\n### Section C: Structured/Essay Questions (40 Marks)\n(Answer any two – 20 marks each)\n\n31. **Full Answer**:\n (a) **Solids**: Particles closely packed in regular pattern, vibrate about fixed positions, strong forces → fixed shape and volume.\n **Liquids**: Particles close but irregular, move randomly/slide past each other → fixed volume, no fixed shape.\n **Gases**: Particles far apart, rapid random motion, negligible forces → no fixed shape or volume.\n (b) Evaporation is the process where liquid changes to vapour at temperature below boiling point.\n Factors: **Increase in temperature** (more kinetic energy); **Increase in surface area** (more particles escape); also wind/dry air/humidity affect rate.\n (c) Applications:\n - **Insects walk on water** (e.g., pond skaters).\n - **Formation of spherical droplets** (minimizes surface area).\n\n32. **Full Answer**:\n (a) Fill measuring cylinder with water, note level. Gently lower irregular solid → note new level. Difference in levels = volume of solid.\n (b) Mass of water = **65 g - 15 g = 50 g**\n Volume of bottle = **50 cm³** (since density water = 1 g/cm³)\n Mass of alcohol = **55 g - 15 g = 40 g**\n Density of alcohol = **40 g / 50 cm³ = 0.8 g/cm³ = 800 kg/m³**\n (c) Precautions:\n - Place on level surface\n - Adjust to zero before use\n - Use riders carefully / avoid parallax\n\n33. **Full Answer**:\n (a) For equilibrium, **sum of clockwise moments = sum of anticlockwise moments** about the pivot.\n Formula: **W₁ × d₁ = W₂ × d₂**\n (b) Crowbar is a lever: effort applied at long arm (large distance from fulcrum) produces small effort force that creates large turning moment to lift heavy load at short arm → multiplies force.\n (c) Take two capillary tubes (one clean glass, one greased). Dip both in water → water rises high in clean tube (adhesion), low or no rise in greased (reduced adhesion). Dip in mercury → depression in clean, less in greased. Shows capillarity depends on adhesion between liquid and tube.\n\n**Grand Total: 100 marks**"
