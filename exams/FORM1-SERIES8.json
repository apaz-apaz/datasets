(5 marks)\n **Answer**:\n Density = mass / volume = **4.05 kg / 0.0005 m³ = 8100 kg/m³**\n Relative density = **8100 / 1000 = 8.1**\n\n25. (3 marks)\n **Answer**: Pressure applied to an enclosed incompressible fluid is transmitted equally and undiminished throughout the fluid and to the walls of the container.\n\n26. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Pressure in water increases with depth (**P = ρgh**). At the base, depth is greatest so pressure is maximum. Thick walls provide strength to withstand this **high pressure**.\n\n27. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Surface tension is the force per unit length acting tangentially on the surface of a liquid due to cohesion.\n Unit: **N/m** (or Newton per metre).\n\n28. (5 marks)\n **Answer**:\n Upthrust = 12 N - 8 N = **4 N**\n Volume displaced = **500 cm³ = 0.0005 m³**\n Mass of liquid displaced = upthrust / g = **4 / 10 = 0.4 kg**\n Density of liquid = mass / volume = **0.4 / 0.0005 = 800 kg/m³**\n\n29. (3 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - Drinking with a straw\n - Using a syringe\n - Lifting with suction cups\n (Any three relevant)\n\n30. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Capillarity is the rise or fall of liquid in a narrow tube due to surface tension.\n Examples: **Water rises** in glass capillary (adhesion > cohesion); **Mercury depresses** in glass capillary (cohesion > adhesion).\n\n**Subtotal: 40 marks**\n\n### Section C: Structured/Essay Questions (40 Marks)\n(Answer any two – 20 marks each)\n\n31. **Full Answer**:\n (a) **Solids**: Particles tightly packed, vibrate in fixed positions, strong forces → definite shape and volume.\n **Liquids**: Particles close but slide past each other, weaker forces → definite volume, no fixed shape.\n **Gases**: Particles far apart, rapid random motion, very weak forces → no definite shape or volume, fill container.\n (b) **Cohesion**: Attraction between same molecules. Example: **Mercury forms spherical drops**.\n **Adhesion**: Attraction between different molecules. Example: **Water wets glass** forming concave meniscus.\n (c) Effects:\n - **Ice floats** on water → lakes don't freeze solid, aquatic life survives.\n - Pipes burst in cold weather due to expansion on freezing.\n\n32. **Full Answer**:\n (a) Fill displacement can with water until it just overflows. Place stone tied with thread gently into can → collect displaced water in measuring cylinder → volume of displaced water equals volume of stone.\n (b) Mass of water = **90 g - 40 g = 50 g**\n Volume of bottle = **50 cm³**\n Mass of paraffin = **88 g - 40 g = 48 g**\n Relative density = **48 / 50 = 0.96**\n (c) Rules:\n - Correct zero error before use\n - Avoid parallax error by reading at eye level\n - Handle instruments carefully to avoid damage\n\n33. **Full Answer**:\n (a) For a body in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about any point equals the sum of anticlockwise moments.\n (b) In a see-saw, the heavier person sits closer to the pivot so that their larger weight produces a smaller moment arm, balancing the lighter person's larger moment arm. Equilibrium when **weight₁ × distance₁ = weight₂ × distance₂**.\n (c) Take identical objects, suspend on spring balance. Immerse in water → note extension/upthrust. Then immerse in denser liquid (e.g., salt water) → greater extension/upthrust. Shows upthrust increases with density of liquid.\n\n**Grand Total: 100 marks**"
