      "content": "THE UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA\nNATIONAL EXAMINATIONS COUNCIL OF TANZANIA\nFORM TWO NATIONAL ASSESSMENT\n041 BASIC MATHEMATICS\n(For Both School and Private Candidates)\nTime: 2:30 Hours\n\nInstructions:\n1.

      "content": "1. (a) Prime factors: 18 = 2 × 3 × 3 = 2 × 3^2. 30 = 2 × 3 × 5. Common primes: 2 and 3. HCF = 2 × 3 = 6.\n   Explanation: Multiply common prime factors with lowest powers.\n\n   (b) 34500 = 3.45 × 10^4.\n   Explanation: Move decimal so that 1 ≤ a < 10, count places moved.\n\n2. (a) 2 hours 45 minutes = (2 × 60) + 45 = 120 + 45 = 165 minutes.\n   (b) 0.9994 to three decimal places: look at fourth decimal (4) < 5 so round down → 0.999.\n   Explanation: Rounding uses the next digit to decide.\n\n3. (a) In isosceles triangle PQ R with PQ = PR, base angles at Q and R are equal. Given angle Q = 50°, so angle R = 50°. Angle P = 180 - (50 + 50) = 80°.\n   (b) Area of circle = π r^2 = (22/7) × 7^2 = (22/7) × 49 = 22 × 7 = 154 cm².\n   Explanation: Use π = 22/7 for exact integer result here.\n\n4. (a) 4(2x - 1) = 3x + 11 → 8x - 4 = 3x + 11 → 8x - 3x = 11 + 4 → 5x = 15 → x = 3.\n   (b) (x + 2)(x - 5) = x^2 - 5x + 2x - 10 = x^2 - 3x - 10.\n   Explanation: Expand using distributive law.\n\n5. (a) Form two students = 3/8 of 240 = (3 × 240)/8 = 720/8 = 90 students.\n   (b) VAT = 18% of 30,000 = 0.18 × 30,000 = 5,400. Total price = 30,000 + 5,400 = 35,400 Tsh.\n   Explanation: Percentage of amount added to original price.\n\n6. (a) Midpoint = ((2+8)/2, (-4+6)/2) = (10/2, 2/2) = (5,1).\n   (b) Rotation 90° anticlockwise: (x,y) → (-y, x). So (1,2) → (-2,1).\n   Explanation: Use rotation rule for 90° anticlockwise.\n\n7. (a) 32 = 2^5. (32)^{2/5} = (2^5)^{2/5} = 2^{5×(2/5)} = 2^2 = 4.\n   (b) log_{10}(x - 2) = 1 → x - 2 = 10^1 = 10 → x = 12.\n   Explanation: Convert log to exponential form.\n\n8. (a) One criterion: AA (Angle-Angle) — if two angles of one triangle equal two angles of another, triangles are similar.\n   (b) Linear ratio = 5:8. Area ratio = (5/8)^2 = 25/64. If smaller area = 125 cm², larger area = 125 × (64/25) = 5 × 64 = 320 cm².\n   Explanation: Multiply smaller area by square of reciprocal of linear ratio.\n\n9. (a) Pythagoras theorem: In a right-angled triangle, (hypotenuse)^2 = (leg1)^2 + (leg2)^2. Given hypotenuse c = 13, one leg a = 5, other leg b satisfies b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 169 - 25 = 144 → b = 12 cm.\n   (b) tan30° = h/20 = 1/√3 → h = 20 × (1/√3) ≈ 20/1.732 ≈ 11.547 m (approx 11.55 m).\n   Explanation: Use tan = opposite/adjacent and evaluate.\n\n10. (a) A = {a,b,c,d}, B = {c,d,e,f}. A ∪ B = {a,b,c,d,e,f}. A ∩ B = {c,d}. B - A = elements in B not in A = {e,f}.\n    (b) Mean = (10+12+14+16+18+20+22)/7 = 112/7 = 16. Median = middle value (4th when ordered) = 16. Mode = no repeated score so no mode (or 'none').\n   Explanation: Mean average; median middle; mode most frequent value (none here)."
