(4 marks)\n **Answer**: A body wholly or partly immersed in a fluid experiences an upthrust equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.\n\n26. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Broad tyres **increase the contact area**, thereby **reducing pressure** on soft soil (P = F/A), preventing the tractor from sinking.\n\n27.

(6 marks)\n **Answer**:\n Upthrust = weight in air - weight in water = **25 N - 15 N = 10 N**\n Relative density = weight in air / upthrust = **25 / 10 = 2.5**\n\n29. (3 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - Causes wear and tear\n - Produces unwanted heat\n - Wastes energy/opposes motion\n\n30. (5 marks)\n **Answer**: Capillarity is the rise or fall of a liquid in a narrow tube due to surface tension.\n Example: **Water rises** in a narrow glass tube because adhesion between water and glass is stronger than cohesion in water.\n\n**Subtotal: 40 marks**\n\n### Section C: Structured/Essay Questions (40 Marks)\n(Answer any two – 20 marks each)\n\n31. **Full Answer**:\n (a) **Solids**: Particles closely packed in fixed positions, strong forces, only vibrate → definite shape and volume.\n **Liquids**: Particles close but can move/slide, weaker forces → definite volume, no definite shape.\n **Gases**: Particles far apart, rapid random motion, negligible forces → no definite shape or volume.\n (b) Water expands on cooling from **4°C to 0°C** (anomalous).\n Importance: **Ice floats** on water, insulating lower layers and protecting aquatic life in cold regions.\n (c) Ways:\n - Lubrication\n - Use of rollers/ball bearings\n\n32. **Full Answer**:\n (a) Check zero error with jaws closed. Insert lower jaws into test tube, gently expand until contact with inner walls. Read main scale + vernier coincidence × least count.\n (b) Mass of water = **72 g - 22 g = 50 g**\n Volume of bottle = **50 cm³**\n Mass of kerosene = **62 g - 22 g = 40 g**\n Density of kerosene = **40 g / 50 cm³ = 0.8 g/cm³ = 800 kg/m³**\n (c) Precautions:\n - Read at eye level to avoid parallax\n - Read at the bottom of meniscus for transparent liquids\n - Ensure cylinder is on level surface\n\n33. **Full Answer**:\n (a) Pressure applied to an enclosed incompressible fluid is transmitted equally and undiminished in all directions.\n (b) Small effort on small piston creates pressure in fluid → transmitted to large piston → large area produces greater force (F = P × A), lifting heavy loads easily.\n (c) Use spring balance to pull a wooden block on different surfaces (glass, sandpaper, wood). Record force needed for constant speed. Greater force on rough surfaces → higher friction.\n\n**Grand Total: 100 marks**"
