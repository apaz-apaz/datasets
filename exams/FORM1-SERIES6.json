(4 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - Mechanics\n - Thermodynamics (Heat)\n - Optics\n - Electricity and Magnetism\n (Any four correct branches)\n\n22. (4 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - **Fundamental quantities** are basic independent quantities e.g., length, mass, time.\n - **Derived quantities** are obtained from fundamental ones e.g., velocity (length/time), density (mass/volume).\n\n23. (3 marks)\n **Answer**:\n °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9  \n = (77 - 32) × 5/9 = 45 × 5/9 = **25°C**\n\n24.

(3 marks)\n **Answer**: A floating body displaces its own weight of the fluid in which it floats.\n\n26. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Broad tyres **increase contact area**, which **decreases pressure** (P = F/A) on soft ground like sand, preventing the vehicle from sinking.\n\n27. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Pressure is **force acting normally per unit area**.  \n SI unit: **Pascal (Pa)** or **N/m²**.\n\n28. (5 marks)\n **Answer**:\n Upthrust = weight in air - apparent weight in water = **20 N - 18 N = 2 N**\n Relative density = weight in air / upthrust = **20 / 2 = 10**  \n (Or RD = density of object / density of water)\n\n29. (3 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - Static friction\n - Sliding (kinetic) friction\n - Rolling friction\n\n30. (5 marks)\n **Answer**: Surface tension is the property of a liquid surface that makes it behave like a stretched elastic membrane due to **cohesive forces** between molecules.  \n Example: **Water strider insects walk on water** because surface tension supports their weight without breaking the surface.\n\n**Subtotal: 40 marks**\n\n### Section C: Structured/Essay Questions (40 Marks)\n(Answer any two – 20 marks each)\n\n31. **Full Answer**:\n (a) **Kinetic theory** states matter is made of tiny particles in constant motion.\n - **Solids**: Particles vibrate about fixed positions; strong forces; definite shape and volume.\n - **Liquids**: Particles move freely but stay close; weaker forces; definite volume, no fixed shape.\n - **Gases**: Particles move rapidly in random directions; very weak forces; no definite shape or volume.\n (b) **Capillarity** is the rise or fall of liquid in a narrow tube due to surface tension.\n - **Rise** (e.g., water in glass tube): Adhesive forces > cohesive → liquid wets tube and rises.\n - **Depression** (e.g., mercury in glass): Cohesive > adhesive → mercury does not wet glass and falls.\n (c) Advantages:\n - Enables **walking and running** (grip with ground).\n - Allows **vehicle brakes** to stop motion safely.\n\n32. **Full Answer**:\n (a) Close jaws and check zero error. Open jaws, place inside beaker, gently close until contact. Read main scale + vernier coincidence × least count for internal diameter.\n (b) Mass of water = **80 g - 30 g = 50 g**\n Volume of bottle = **50 cm³** (since 1 g water = 1 cm³)\n Mass of oil = **70 g - 30 g = 40 g**\n Density of oil = **40 g / 50 cm³ = 0.8 g/cm³** = **800 kg/m³**\n (c) Sources:\n - **Zero error** – correct by subtracting/adding.\n - **Parallax** – read perpendicularly.\n - **Instrument wear** – use calibrated tools.\n\n33. **Full Answer**:\n (a) **Archimedes' principle**: A body immersed wholly or partially in a fluid experiences an upthrust equal to the weight of fluid displaced.\n (b) Submarine has ballast tanks.\n - To **float**: Fill tanks with air → reduce overall density → upthrust > weight.\n - To **sink**: Fill tanks with water → increase density → weight > upthrust.\n Controls depth by adjusting amount of water/air.\n (c) **Experiment**: Fix spring vertically, note natural length. Add known weights one by one, measure extension each time. Plot graph of extension vs force – straight line through origin verifies Hooke's law (within elastic limit).\n\n**Grand Total: 100 marks**"
