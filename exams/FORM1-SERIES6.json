Mercury falls because **cohesion** (mercury-mercury attraction) is stronger than **adhesion** (mercury-glass attraction).\n\n**Subtotal: 40 marks**\n\n### Section C: Structured/Essay Questions (40 Marks)\n(Answer any two – 20 marks each)\n\n31. (a) **Kinetic theory**:  \n**Solids** – particles vibrate in fixed positions, strong forces, definite shape & volume.  
**Liquids** – particles move freely but close together, weaker forces, definite volume, no definite shape.  
**Gases** – particles move rapidly and randomly, very weak forces, no definite shape or volume.  \n(b) **Anomalous expansion**: Water expands when cooled from **4°C to 0°C** instead of contracting.  
**Importance**: Ice floats on water, insulating aquatic life in winter.  \n(c) **Adhesion** – attraction between molecules of different substances.  
Example: Water sticks to glass surface (wetting).  \n(d) **Hydrometer** – floats with stem above liquid. In denser liquid, it sinks less → **higher reading** on stem.\n\n32. (a) **Procedure**:  \nZero the micrometer → place wire between anvil & spindle → rotate thimble gently until ratchet clicks → read main scale + thimble scale + sleeve scale.  \n(b) Mass of water = **80 g – 30 g = 50 g** → volume = **50 cm³**  
Mass of oil = **70 g – 30 g = 40 g**  
Relative density = **40 / 50 = 0.8**  \n(c) **Precautions**:  \n- Check zero error and correct it  \n- Read scale perpendicularly (avoid parallax)  \n- Do not apply excessive force\n\n33. (a) **Pascal’s principle**: Pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted **equally and undiminished** in all directions.  \n(b) **Hydraulic press**: Small piston applies force → pressure = F₁/A₁ → transmitted to large piston → large force F₂ = P × A₂ → lifts heavy load.  \n(c) **Experiment**: Place a block on a wooden surface → measure force needed to pull it with spring balance. Apply oil → repeat → force is lower → friction reduced.  \n(d) **Advantages**: Walking, braking, writing, holding objects\n\n**Grand Total: 100 marks**"
