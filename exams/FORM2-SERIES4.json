  "content": "1. (i) C (ii) D (iii) C (iv) B (v) C (vi) B (vii) C (viii) B (ix) C (x) D\n\nExplanation:\nEach correct option is chosen based on standard physics definitions and SI units. For example, force is measured in Newton, while velocity includes both speed and direction, making it a vector quantity.\n\n2. (i) B (ii) A (iii) E (iv) D (v) C\n\nExplanation:\nMatching is done by understanding the meaning of each term. Inertia refers to resistance to motion, while density is mass per unit volume.\n\n3. (a) Force is a push or pull that can change the shape, speed or direction of an object.\n\nExplanation:\nForce acts on objects and causes motion, stopping, or deformation depending on how it is applied.\n\n(b) One effect of force is that it can change the speed of a moving object.\n\n4. (a) Speed is the distance travelled per unit time.\n\nExplanation:\nSpeed tells us how fast an object is moving without considering direction.\n\n(b) Speed = Distance / Time\n\nSpeed = 200 ÷ 10 = 20 m/s\n\nExplanation:\nWe divide the total distance travelled by the time taken to obtain speed.\n\n5. (a) Pressure is the force acting per unit area.\n\nExplanation:\nPressure increases when force increases or when the area decreases.\n\n(b) Pressure = Force / Area\n\nPressure = 500 ÷ 2 = 250 Pa\n\nExplanation:\nPressure is measured in Pascal (Pa), which is equal to N/m².\n\n6. (a) Iron sinks because its density is greater than that of water, while wood floats because its density is less than water.\n\nExplanation:\nAccording to Archimedes’ principle, an object floats if its density is lower than the fluid.\n\n(b) Weight = mass × g\n\nWeight = 2 × 10 = 20 N\n\nExplanation:\nWeight is the force due to gravity acting on a body.\n\n7. (a) Work is done when a force moves an object through a distance in the direction of the force.\n\n(b) Work = Force × Distance\n\nWork = 20 × 5 = 100 J\n\nExplanation:\nWork is measured in Joules and only occurs when movement happens.\n\n8. (a) A simple machine is a device that makes work easier by changing the magnitude or direction of force.\n\n(b) Lever, pulley, inclined plane.\n\nExplanation:\nSimple machines reduce effort needed to do work.\n\n9. (a) Heat is a form of energy that flows from a hotter body to a colder body.\n\n(b) Heat is energy in transfer, while temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of a body.\n\nExplanation:\nTwo objects may have the same temperature but different amounts of heat.\n\n10. (a) Reflection of light is the bouncing back of light when it strikes a surface.\n\n(b) Laws of reflection:\n- The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n- The incident ray, reflected ray and normal lie in the same plane.\n\nExplanation:\nThese laws explain how mirrors form images.\n\n11. (a) Make holes at different heights in a water-filled container. Water from the lower hole flows farther, showing pressure increases with depth.\n\nExplanation:\nThe deeper the liquid, the greater the pressure due to weight of liquid above.\n\n(b) Hydraulic brakes, water supply systems.\n\nExplanation:\nPressure in liquids is applied in many machines for efficient force transmission.\n"

(i) A (ii) C (iii) C (iv) A (v) B (vi) B (vii) B (viii) A (ix) A (x) B\n\nExplanation:\n- Transpiration is the release of water vapour from plants into the atmosphere.\n- Frontal rainfall occurs when warm and cold air masses meet.\n- Malagarasi is the longest river in Tanzania.\n- Climate represents long-term average weather patterns.\n- Savannah vegetation has grasses with scattered trees.\n- Rain gauges measure rainfall.\n- Weathering is the breakdown of rocks.\n- Tanzania is between 1°N - 12°S and 29°E - 41°E.\n- Longitude measures east-west distance from the Prime Meridian.\n- Stratosphere contains the ozone layer.\n\n2.

(a) [Diagram: Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere, Exosphere]\n\n   (b) Importance: protects from harmful radiation; maintains temperature; supports breathing and weather formation.\n\nSECTION B\n\n7. (a) Large lakes moderate temperatures because water heats and cools slowly, reducing extremes.\n\n   (b) Prevailing winds bring moist air from oceans, influencing rainfall amounts and patterns.\n\n8. (a) Population distribution is the spread of people over an area.\n\n   (b) Factors: availability of water, fertile soils, economic opportunities, relief, climate.\n\n9. (a) Fishing is the capture of fish and other aquatic organisms from water bodies.\n\n   (b) Importance: provides food, employment, foreign exchange through exports, supports livelihoods.\n\n10. (a) Renewable resources can be replenished naturally (e.g., sunlight, water); non-renewable resources are finite (e.g., coal, petroleum, minerals).\n\n    (b) Renewable: solar energy, wind, water. Non-renewable: coal, petroleum, uranium.\n\nSECTION C\n\n11. (a) Experiment:\n- Materials: two plots of land, grass, soil, water.\n- Procedure: Plot A with vegetation, Plot B bare. Simulate rainfall and observe soil erosion.\n- Observation: Bare plot experiences more soil loss; vegetated plot retains soil.\n- Conclusion: Overgrazing or lack of vegetation increases soil erosion.\n\n(b) Effects of overgrazing:\n1. Loss of topsoil reduces fertility.\n2. Desertification and land degradation.\n3. Reduced agricultural productivity and livestock feeding areas.\n\n(c) Measures to reduce overgrazing:\n1. Controlled grazing and rotational grazing systems.\n2. Planting fodder crops.\n3. Educating farmers and enforcing land management policies.\n\nExplanation: This paper focuses on vegetation, water cycle, population, climate, human-environment interaction, and sustainable resource management, providing **detailed answers with explanations** to ensure students understand the concepts clearly."
