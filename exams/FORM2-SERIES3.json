    "content": "SECTION A\n\n1. Multiple choice answers (with short explanations)\n\n(i) C. Pascal — Pressure is force per unit area and its SI unit is pascal (Pa) which equals N/m².\n\n(ii) B. Acceleration — Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with time.\n\n(iii) C. Beyond the centre of curvature — A concave mirror produces a real, inverted image when the object is beyond the centre of curvature.\n\n(iv) C. Sublimation — Sublimation is the direct change from solid to gas without passing through liquid.\n\n(v) B. Ammeter — An ammeter measures electric current and must be connected in series.\n\n(vi) B. Watt — Power is the rate of doing work; its SI unit is watt (W) which equals J/s.\n\n(vii) B. 40 J — Kinetic energy is given by \\(\\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2\\). For m = 5 kg and v = 4 m/s: \\(KE = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\times5\\times4^2 = 40\\ \\text{J}\\).\n\n(viii) C. Refraction — Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another due to change in speed.\n\n(ix) B. Transformer — A transformer increases or decreases alternating voltage using electromagnetic induction.\n\n(x) C. Period — The period is the time for one complete oscillation of a pendulum.\n\n2. Matching\n\n(i) C; (ii) A; (iii) D; (iv) E; (v) B\n\nExplanations:\n- Archimedes’ principle (C): the buoyant force equals the weight of fluid displaced.\n- Hooke’s law (A): within elastic limit, extension ∝ applied force.\n- Conservation of energy (D): energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.\n- Coulomb’s law (E): electrostatic force ∝ product of charges / distance².\n- Law of reflection (B): angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.\n\n3. Work\n\n(a) Definition: Work is the product of the component of force in the direction of displacement and the magnitude of the displacement. When force and displacement are along the same line, \\(W = F s\\).\n\n(b) Calculation: \\(W = F \\times s = 20\\ \\text{N} \\times 3\\ \\text{m} = 60\\ \\text{J}.\\)\n\nExplanation: Work transfers energy to the object; units are joules (J).\n\n4. Newton’s second law and application\n\n(a) Statement: The net force acting on a body equals the mass of the body multiplied by its acceleration, \\(F_{net} = m a\\).\n\n(b) Calculation:\n- Acceleration: \\(a = \\dfrac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t} = \\dfrac{10 - 0}{5} = 2\\ \\text{m/s}^2.\\)\n- Net force: \\(F = m a = 800\\ \\text{kg} \\times 2\\ \\text{m/s}^2 = 1600\\ \\text{N}.\\)\n\nExplanation: Use change in velocity over time for acceleration, then multiply by mass to get net force.\n\n5. Specific heat capacity\n\n(a) Definition: Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1°C. Symbol: c, units: J/(kg·°C).\n\n(b) Calculation: Use \\(Q = m c \\Delta T\\).\n- m = 2 kg, c = 4200 J/(kg·°C), \\(\\Delta T = 80 - 20 = 60^\\circ\\text{C}.\\)\n- \\(Q = 2 \\times 4200 \\times 60 = 504000\\ \\text{J}.\\)\n\nExplanation: Always include units and show each step; heat required is large because water has high specific heat.\n\n6. Electric circuit and safety\n\n(a) Diagram description: A battery (cell) connected by wires to a resistor; an ammeter is placed in series with the resistor and the circuit is closed with a switch. Labels: battery (+ and -), resistor (R), ammeter (A), switch, connecting wires.\n\n(b) Safety precautions:\n- Always switch off the power supply before building or changing the circuit.\n- Use components rated for the expected current and avoid short circuits; never touch live connections.\n\nExplanation: An ammeter must be in series; a voltmeter (not shown) would be connected in parallel.\n\nSECTION B\n\n7. Buoyancy and floating\n\n(a) Explanation: Whether an object floats or sinks depends on its average density relative to the fluid and the buoyant force (upthrust) acting on it. Archimedes’ principle states that the upthrust equals the weight of the fluid displaced. If the upthrust is equal to or greater than the object's weight, the object floats; if it is less, the object sinks.\n\n(b) Calculation:\n- Volume of block, V = 0.02 m³.\n- Density of water, \\(\\rho_{water} = 1000\\ \\text{kg/m}^3.\\)\n- Mass of water displaced if fully submerged = \\(\\rho V = 1000 \\times 0.02 = 20\\ \\text{kg}.\\)\n- Upthrust = weight of displaced water = mass × g = \\(20 \\times 10 = 200\\ \\text{N}.\\)\n- Weight of block = mass × g = \\(10 \\times 10 = 100\\ \\text{N}.\\)\n\nConclusion: Upthrust (200 N) > weight (100 N), so the block floats. In practice the block will float with part of its volume submerged until the displaced water weight equals 100 N.\n\nExplanation: The block’s average density is 10 kg / 0.02 m³ = 500 kg/m³, which is less than water, so it floats.\n\n8. Efficiency\n\n(a) Definition and formula: Efficiency measures how well a machine converts input energy into useful output energy. \\(\\text{Efficiency} = \\dfrac{\\text{useful energy output}}{\\text{energy input}} \\times 100\\%\\).\n\n(b) Calculation: Useful output = 1500 J, input = 2000 J.\n\n\\(\\text{Efficiency} = \\dfrac{1500}{2000} \\times 100\\% = 75\\% .\\)\n\nExplanation: The remaining 25% is lost (e.g., heat, friction).\n\n9. Series vs parallel and circuit calculation\n\n(a) Explanation:\n- Series: same current flows through each component; total potential difference is shared; resistances add: \\(R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + \\dots\\).\n- Parallel: same potential difference across each branch; total current is sum of branch currents; reciprocals of resistances add: \\(\\dfrac{1}{R_{total}} = \\dfrac{1}{R_1} + \\dfrac{1}{R_2} + \\dots\\).\n\n(b) Calculation (series):\n- Total resistance: \\(R_{total} = 2 + 3 + 6 = 11\\ \\Omega.\\)\n- Current: \\(I = \\dfrac{V}{R_{total}} = \\dfrac{22}{11} = 2\\ \\text{A}.\\)\n\nExplanation: Use Ohm’s law and add resistances for series circuits.\n\n10. Convex lens when object is between lens and focal point\n\n(a) Description: When an object is placed between a convex lens and its focal point (i.e., closer to the lens than the focal length), the lens produces a virtual, erect and magnified image. The refracted rays diverge after passing through the lens; when these diverging rays are extended backwards, they appear to meet at a point on the same side of the lens as the object — that point is the virtual image.\n\n(b) Ray diagram description: Draw the principal axis and the convex lens. Mark the focal points F on both sides. From the top of the object draw:\n- Ray 1: parallel to the principal axis, after refraction it appears to come from the focal point on the same side (draw refracted ray diverging).\n- Ray 2: through the centre of the lens, which continues straight without deviation.\nExtend the diverging refracted ray backward (dashed line) and find its intersection with the straight ray; the intersection is the virtual, erect, enlarged image located on the same side of the lens as the object.\n\nExplanation: Because the image is virtual it cannot be projected on a screen; it is seen by looking through the lens.\n\nSECTION C\n\n11. Focal length experiment and image characteristics\n\n(a) Experiment (distant object method):\n1. Mount the convex lens on a stand and place a screen (e.g., white card) on the other side.\n2. Point the lens toward a distant object (a tree or building far away) so that incoming light rays are effectively parallel.\n3. Move the screen back and forth until a sharp image of the distant object appears on the screen.\n4. Measure the distance between the lens and the screen; for parallel incoming rays this distance approximates the focal length f of the lens.\n5. Repeat the measurement several times and take the average to reduce error.\n\nHow to calculate: For a distant object, the image forms at the focal plane, so measured lens-to-screen distance ≈ focal length f.\n\n(b) Calculation: Measured distance = 24 cm, therefore focal length f ≈ 24 cm.\n\n(c) Three characteristics of images formed by a convex lens when the object is beyond 2F:\n- The image is real (it can be projected on a screen).\n- The image is inverted (upside down relative to the object).\n- The image is reduced in size (smaller than the object).\n\nExplanation: For objects beyond 2F, rays converge to form an image between F and 2F on the opposite side; geometry of similar triangles shows the image is smaller.\n\nTEACHER NOTES\n\n- Encourage students to always show units at every step and to draw clear, labelled diagrams for optics and circuits.\n- For multiple-choice printing, verify option letters match the intended answers to avoid confusion.\n- When marking, award method marks for correct steps even if the final numerical answer has minor arithmetic errors.\n\nEnd of answers."
