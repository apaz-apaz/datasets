      "content": "1. (a) Multiples of 5: 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50. Multiples of 9: 9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72,81,90. LCM = 45. Explanation: The least common multiple is the smallest number appearing in both lists.\n\n (b) Three significant figures: 0.0790. Two decimal places: 0.08.\n\n2. (a) 7.2 km = 7200 m. 3600 g = 3.6 kg.\n\n (b) Nearest thousand: 2000. Three decimal places: 2345.678.\n\n3. (a) In trapezium, consecutive angles between parallel sides are supplementary. Angle W = 75°, X = 105°. So angle Y = 75°, angle Z = 105°.\n\n (b) Perimeter = 2(12+7) = 38 cm. Area = 12 × 7 = 84 cm².\n\n4. (a) 4x + 9 = 25 → 4x = 16 → x = 4.\n\n (b) x² - 8x + 15 = (x-3)(x-5). Roots: x = 3, 5.\n\n5. (a) Total parts = 5. Each part = 50/5 = 10. Red = 2×10 = 20. Blue = 3×10 = 30.\n\n (b) Profit = 20% of 80,000 = 16,000. Selling price = 96,000 Tsh.\n\n6. (a) Slope = (3 - (-1))/(6 - 2) = 4/4 = 1. Equation: y - (-1) = 1(x - 2) → y + 1 = x - 2 → y = x - 3.\n\n (b) Reflection in x-axis: (x,y) → (x,-y). So (3,4) → (3,-4).\n\n7. (a) 32^{2/5} = (2^5)^{2/5} = 2^2 = 4. 125^{1/3} = 5. Product = 20.\n\n (b) log(x+2) = 2 + log(x-1). → log(x+2) - log(x-1) = 2. → log((x+2)/(x-1)) = 2. → (x+2)/(x-1) = 100. → x+2 = 100x - 100. → 102 = 99x. → x = 102/99 ≈ 1.03. Explanation: Check domain: x>1, valid.\n\n8. (a) RHS: If two right-angled triangles have equal hypotenuse and one side equal, they are congruent.\n\n (b) Ratio of sides = 4/5.

Mode = 55,65,75,85,95 (all appear twice).\n\nExplanation: Mean is average, median is middle value, mode is most frequent.\n"
