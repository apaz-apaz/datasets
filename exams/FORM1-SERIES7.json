(4 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - Engineering\n - Medicine (radiology)\n - Teaching\n - Aviation (pilot)\n (Any four relevant careers)\n\n22. (3 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - **Scalars** have magnitude only; **vectors** have magnitude and direction.\n - **Scalars** added algebraically; **vectors** by vector methods.\n - Examples: Scalar - distance; Vector - displacement.\n\n23. (2 marks)\n **Answer**:\n K = °C + 273  \n **40 + 273 = 313 K**\n\n24. (5 marks)\n **Answer**:\n Density = mass / volume = **8 kg / 0.004 m³ = 2000 kg/m³**\n Since **2000 > 1000 kg/m³**, the object will **sink** in water.\n\n25. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: When a body is wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, it experiences an **upthrust equal to the weight of the fluid displaced**.\n\n26. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Camel has **broad feet** which **increase surface area**, thereby **reducing pressure** on sand (P = F/A), preventing it from sinking deeply.\n\n27. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Upthrust is the **upward force exerted by a fluid** on a body immersed in it.\n Formula: **Upthrust = weight of fluid displaced** or **U = ρVg** (ρ = density of fluid, V = volume displaced, g = gravity).\n\n28. (4 marks)\n **Answer**:\n Mass of water displaced = **500 cm³ × 1 g/cm³ = 500 g**\n Weight = **500 g × 0.01 N/g = 5 N** (or 500 × 10 / 1000 = 5 N)\n So weight of object = **5 N**.\n\n29. (3 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - Causes wear and tear of machine parts\n - Produces unwanted heat\n - Wastes energy (e.g., more fuel needed)\n\n30. (5 marks)\n **Answer**: Adhesion is the **attractive force between molecules of different substances**.\n Example: **Water sticks to glass** in a tube, causing the meniscus to be concave and enabling capillary rise.\n\n**Subtotal: 40 marks**\n\n### Section C: Structured/Essay Questions (40 Marks)\n(Answer any two – 20 marks each)\n\n31. **Full Answer**:\n (a) **Solids**: Particles closely packed in fixed positions, strong intermolecular forces, vibrate only, definite shape and volume.\n **Liquids**: Particles close but can move/slide past each other, weaker forces, definite volume but take shape of container.\n **Gases**: Particles far apart, move randomly at high speed, very weak forces, no definite shape or volume.\n (b) Water contracts on cooling from higher temperatures to **4°C**, then expands from **4°C to 0°C**.\n Significances: **Ice floats** on water, preventing lakes from freezing completely; protects aquatic life in winter.\n (c) Ways:\n - Use **lubricants** to separate surfaces.\n - Use **rollers or ball bearings** to change sliding to rolling friction.\n\n32. **Full Answer**:\n (a) Check zero error (close jaws, reading should be zero). Place wire between spindle and anvil, rotate thimble until ratchet clicks. Read main scale + circular scale value for total thickness.\n (b) Mass of water = **70 g - 20 g = 50 g**\n Volume of bottle = **50 cm³** (density water 1 g/cm³)\n Mass of liquid = **66 g - 20 g = 46 g**\n Relative density = mass of liquid / mass of equal volume water = **46 / 50 = 0.92**\n (c) Precautions:\n - Handle with care to avoid breakage\n - Do not heat thin glass directly\n - Use tongs for hot glassware\n\n33. **Full Answer**:\n (a) **Pascal's principle**: Pressure applied to an enclosed incompressible fluid is transmitted equally and undiminished to every part of the fluid and container walls.\n Application: **Hydraulic brakes/press**.\n (b) Small piston applies force → creates pressure in fluid → pressure acts on large piston with bigger area → produces larger force (F = P × A), multiplying force to lift heavy loads.\n (c) Take plastic bottle, fill with water, cover tightly. Poke holes – water jets out strongly due to atmospheric pressure pushing water out when cap is loose, but stops when air can't enter if tightly sealed (or crush empty bottle with cap – hard, but easy when open).\n\n**Grand Total: 100 marks**"
