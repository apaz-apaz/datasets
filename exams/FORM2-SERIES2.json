(i) B (Zoology: the branch of biology that studies animals)\n   (ii) B (Respiration: the process of breaking down food to release energy)\n   (iii) C (Cell: the basic structural and functional unit of life)\n   (iv) B (Cell membrane: controls movement of substances in and out of the cell)\n   (v) B (Mitochondrion: generates energy in the form of ATP)\n   (vi) B (Roots: main organs for water absorption)\n   (vii) B (Meiosis produces 4 genetically different gametes)\n   (viii) A (Blood components: plasma, RBCs, WBCs, platelets)\n   (ix) B (Lipase: digests fats into fatty acids and glycerol)\n   (x) B (Lungs: main organs for gaseous exchange)\n\n2. (i) B (Diffusion: movement from high to low concentration)\n   (ii) A (Osmosis: movement of water across semi-permeable membrane)\n   (iii) C (Active transport: movement against concentration gradient with energy)\n   (iv) D (Transpiration: loss of water vapour from leaves)\n   (v) E (Photosynthesis: plants make food using sunlight)\n\n3. (a) An organism is any living being that can carry out life processes independently.\n\n   (b) Characteristics: growth, reproduction, response to stimuli, nutrition, respiration.\n\n4. (a) Eyepiece, objective lens, stage, mirror/light source, coarse adjustment, fine adjustment, base, arm.\n\n   (b) Total magnification = eyepiece magnification × objective lens magnification. Example: 10× × 40× = 400×\n\n5. (a) Tissue is a group of cells with similar structure and function.\n\n   (b) Types of plant tissues:\n       - Xylem: transports water and minerals from roots to leaves\n       - Phloem: transports food from leaves to other parts of the plant\n\n6. (a) [Diagram showing: nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane, mitochondria, ribosomes, Golgi body]\n\n   (b) Differences:\n       - Plant cells have cell wall; animal cells do not.\n       - Plant cells have chloroplasts; animal cells do not.\n       - Plant cells have a large central vacuole; animal cells have small vacuoles.\n\n7. (a) Chlorophyll absorbs light energy and converts it into chemical energy during photosynthesis.\n\n   (b) 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ (with sunlight and chlorophyll)\n\n8. (a) Excretion is the removal of metabolic wastes from the body. Importance: prevents accumulation of harmful substances, maintains homeostasis.\n\n   (b) Humans excrete via lungs (CO₂), skin (sweat), kidneys (urine).\n\n9. (a) Transport in animals is the movement of substances like nutrients, oxygen, and waste in the body.\n\n   (b) Blood circulates via heart pumping; arteries carry oxygenated blood away, veins return deoxygenated blood.\n\n10. (a) Functions of skeleton: support, protection, movement, blood cell production, mineral storage.\n\n    (b) Joints allow bones to move relative to each other, enabling flexibility and mobility.\n\n11. (a) Experiment: cover part of a leaf with aluminium foil, expose to sunlight, test both covered and uncovered parts with iodine. Only uncovered parts turn blue-black (starch present), showing light is necessary.\n\n    (b) Leaves appear green because chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light but reflects green light.\n\n    (c) Factors affecting transpiration: light intensity, temperature, humidity, wind speed, soil water availability.\n"
