"content": "1. (a) 0.0000456 = 4.56 × 10⁻⁵\n   (Explanation: Move the decimal point 5 places to the right to get 4.56, so the exponent is -5.)\n\n   (b) First, 3/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 + 2/4 = 5/4\n      Then, 2/3 - 1/6 = 4/6 - 1/6 = 3/6 = 1/2\n      Now, (5/4) ÷ (1/2) = 5/4 × 2/1 = 10/4 = 2.5\n   (Answer: 2.5)\n\n   (c) 15% of x = 45 → 0.15x = 45 → x = 45 / 0.15 = 300\n   (Answer: x = 300)\n\n2. (a) 2 km = 2 × 1000 m = 2000 m = 2000 × 1000 mm = 2,000,000 mm\n   (Answer: 2,000,000 mm)\n\n   (b) 456.789 → The first three digits are 457 (since 6 is followed by 7 ≥ 5, round up)\n   (Answer: 457)\n\n   (c) Percentage error = (absolute error / measured value) × 100% = (0.05 / 5.2) × 100% ≈ 0.96%\n   (Answer: ≈ 0.96%)\n\n3. (a) [Draw a circle with radius 3 cm and mark O at the centre.]\n   (b) Perimeter = 2 × (length + width) = 2 × (8 + 5) = 2 × 13 = 26 cm\n   (Answer: 26 cm)\n\n   (c) Area = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 10 × 6 = 30 cm²\n   (Answer: 30 cm²)\n\n4. (a) 3x + 2y - x + 4y = (3x - x) + (2y + 4y) = 2x + 6y\n   (Answer: 2x + 6y)\n\n   (b) x² - 5x + 6 = 0 → (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 → x = 2 or x = 3\n   (Answer: x = 2 or x = 3)\n\n   (c) 4a² - 9b² = (2a)² - (3b)² = (2a - 3b)(2a + 3b)\n   (Answer: (2a - 3b)(2a + 3b))\n\n5. (a) Total parts = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10\n      120 ÷ 10 = 12\n      So, 2: 24; 3: 36; 5: 60\n   (Answer: 24 : 36 : 60)\n\n   (b) Profit = Selling price - Cost price = 10000 - 8000 = 2000\n      Profit % = (2000 / 8000) × 100% = 25%\n   (Answer: 25%)\n\n   (c) Selling price = Cost price × (1 - loss%) = CP × 0.8 = 16000\n      CP = 16000 / 0.8 = 20000 TSh\n   (Answer: 20000 TSh)\n\n6. (a) [Plot points: (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) on graph paper.]\n   (b) The transformation is reflection over the x-axis (all y-coordinates change sign).\n   (Answer: Reflection over the x-axis)\n\n   (c) Slope m = (5 - 2)/(3 - 0) = 3/3 = 1\n      Equation: y - 2 = 1(x - 0) → y = x + 2\n   (Answer: y = x + 2)\n\n7. (a) 2³ = 8, 3² = 9, 8 × 9 = 72, 72 ÷ 6 = 12\n   (Answer: 12)\n\n   (b) √(x + 1) = 3 → x + 1 = 9 → x = 8\n   (Answer: x = 8)\n\n   (c) log₁₀ 1000 = log₁₀ (10³) = 3\n   (Answer: 3)\n\n8. (a) Conditions: SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side)\n   (Answer: SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, RHS)\n\n   (b) Scale factor = 2:3 (smaller:larger), so for 4 cm in smaller, in larger: (3/2) × 4 = 6 cm\n   (Answer: 6 cm)\n\n   (c) Two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal (AA similarity).\n   (Answer: AA similarity criterion)\n\n9. (a) Check: 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5² → Yes, it satisfies Pythagoras theorem.\n   (Answer: Verified)\n\n   (b) sin 30° = 1/2 = 0.5, cos 60° = 1/2 = 0.5, 0.5 + 0.5 = 1\n   (Answer: 1)\n\n   (c) By Pythagoras: Distance from wall = √(5² - 4²) = √(25 - 16) = √9 = 3 m\n   (Answer: 3 m)\n\n10.
