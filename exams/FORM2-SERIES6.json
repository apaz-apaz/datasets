  "content": "1. (i) C (ii) D (iii) C (iv) B (v) C (vi) B (vii) C (viii) B (ix) C (x) D\n\nExplanation:\nEach correct option is chosen based on standard physics definitions and SI units. For example, force is measured in Newton, while velocity includes both speed and direction, making it a vector quantity.\n\n2. (i) B (ii) A (iii) E (iv) D (v) C\n\nExplanation:\nMatching is done by understanding the meaning of each term. Inertia refers to resistance to motion, while density is mass per unit volume.\n\n3. (a) Force is a push or pull that can change the shape, speed or direction of an object.\n\nExplanation:\nForce acts on objects and causes motion, stopping, or deformation depending on how it is applied.\n\n(b) One effect of force is that it can change the speed of a moving object.\n\n4. (a) Speed is the distance travelled per unit time.\n\nExplanation:\nSpeed tells us how fast an object is moving without considering direction.\n\n(b) Speed = Distance / Time\n\nSpeed = 200 ÷ 10 = 20 m/s\n\nExplanation:\nWe divide the total distance travelled by the time taken to obtain speed.\n\n5. (a) Pressure is the force acting per unit area.\n\nExplanation:\nPressure increases when force increases or when the area decreases.\n\n(b) Pressure = Force / Area\n\nPressure = 500 ÷ 2 = 250 Pa\n\nExplanation:\nPressure is measured in Pascal (Pa), which is equal to N/m².\n\n6. (a) Iron sinks because its density is greater than that of water, while wood floats because its density is less than water.\n\nExplanation:\nAccording to Archimedes’ principle, an object floats if its density is lower than the fluid.\n\n(b) Weight = mass × g\n\nWeight = 2 × 10 = 20 N\n\nExplanation:\nWeight is the force due to gravity acting on a body.\n\n7. (a) Work is done when a force moves an object through a distance in the direction of the force.\n\n(b) Work = Force × Distance\n\nWork = 20 × 5 = 100 J\n\nExplanation:\nWork is measured in Joules and only occurs when movement happens.\n\n8. (a) A simple machine is a device that makes work easier by changing the magnitude or direction of force.\n\n(b) Lever, pulley, inclined plane.\n\nExplanation:\nSimple machines reduce effort needed to do work.\n\n9. (a) Heat is a form of energy that flows from a hotter body to a colder body.\n\n(b) Heat is energy in transfer, while temperature is the degree of hotness or coldness of a body.\n\nExplanation:\nTwo objects may have the same temperature but different amounts of heat.\n\n10. (a) Reflection of light is the bouncing back of light when it strikes a surface.\n\n(b) Laws of reflection:\n- The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\n- The incident ray, reflected ray and normal lie in the same plane.\n\nExplanation:\nThese laws explain how mirrors form images.\n\n11. (a) Make holes at different heights in a water-filled container. Water from the lower hole flows farther, showing pressure increases with depth.\n\nExplanation:\nThe deeper the liquid, the greater the pressure due to weight of liquid above.\n\n(b) Hydraulic brakes, water supply systems.\n\nExplanation:\nPressure in liquids is applied in many machines for efficient force transmission.\n"

(a) Excretion is the removal of metabolic wastes from the body to maintain homeostasis and prevent harm.\n\n   (b) Human excretory system: kidneys filter blood to produce urine, lungs remove CO₂, skin removes sweat.\n\n9. (a) Transport in plants is the movement of water, minerals, and food substances within the plant.\n\n   (b) Xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves using capillary action and transpiration pull. Phloem transports food from leaves to other parts of the plant through translocation.\n\n10. (a) Functions: support, protection, movement, blood cell formation, mineral storage.\n\n    (b) Joints:\n        - Hinge joints (elbow, knee): allow bending and straightening.\n        - Ball and socket joints (shoulder, hip): allow movement in many directions.\n        - Pivot joints (neck): allow rotation.\n\n11. (a) Experiment: Cover part of a leaf with green paper to block chlorophyll, expose to sunlight, then test with iodine. Only uncovered green parts turn blue-black, showing chlorophyll is necessary.\n\n    (b) Leaves appear yellow during nutrient deficiency because chlorophyll production decreases, revealing yellow pigments (carotenoids).\n\n    (c) Factors affecting photosynthesis: light intensity, CO₂ concentration, temperature, water availability, chlorophyll content.\n"
