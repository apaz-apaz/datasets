(4 marks)\n Answers:\n - Length: metre (m)\n - Mass: kilogram (kg)\n - Time: second (s)\n - Temperature: kelvin (K)\n\n22. (3 marks)\n Answer: Upthrust is the upward buoyant force exerted by a fluid on an immersed object\n Direction: upwards\n\n23. (2 marks)\n Answer: K = °C + 273 → 37 + 273 = 310 K\n\n24.

Full Answer:\n (a) Cohesion: attraction between like molecules (e.g., water droplets spherical)\n Adhesion: attraction between unlike molecules (e.g., water wets glass)\n (b) Water expands on cooling from 4°C to 0°C instead of contracting\n Advantage: Ice floats, preventing lakes from freezing completely and protecting aquatic life\n (c) Particles closely packed, vibrate in fixed positions, strong cohesive forces, definite shape and volume\n (d) Needle supported by surface tension; dimpled surface creates upward force balancing weight without breaking surface\n\n32. Full Answer:\n (a) Place thread along curved line, mark ends, straighten thread and measure length with ruler\n (b) Mass of water = 90 g - 40 g = 50 g\n Volume = 50 cm³ (or 0.00005 m³)\n Mass of liquid = 80 g - 40 g = 40 g\n Density = 40 g / 50 cm³ = 0.8 g/cm³ or 800 kg/m³\n (c) Sources of error:\n - Zero error\n - Parallax error\n - Overtightening jaws\n\n33.
