(4 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - Explains natural phenomena\n - Helps in technology development\n - Improves problem-solving skills\n - Useful in careers like engineering/medicine\n (Any four relevant)\n\n22. (4 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - **Base quantities** are independent (e.g., length, mass).\n - **Derived quantities** are obtained from base ones (e.g., velocity = length/time).\n\n23. (2 marks)\n **Answer**:\n K = °C + 273  \n **25 + 273 = 298 K**\n\n24. (5 marks)\n **Answer**:\n Density = mass / volume = **7.9 kg / 0.001 m³ = 7900 kg/m³**\n Relative density = **7900 / 1000 = 7.9**\n\n25. (3 marks)\n **Answer**: The extension produced in a spring is directly proportional to the applied force provided the elastic limit is not exceeded (**F = k e**).\n\n26. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Sharp edge has **smaller area**, so same force produces **greater pressure** (**P = F/A**), making cutting easier.\n\n27. (5 marks)\n **Answer**: Upthrust is the **upward force exerted by a fluid** on an immersed body.\n Factors: **Density of fluid** and **volume of body displaced** (U = ρ fluid × V displaced × g).\n\n28. (5 marks)\n **Answer**:\n Upthrust = 50 N - 30 N = **20 N**\n Relative density of liquid = density liquid / density water = upthrust / (weight in air - upthrust) wait no:\n Actually, RD = weight in air / (weight in air - weight in liquid) = **50 / (50 - 30) = 50 / 20 = 2.5**\n\n29.

(5 marks)\n **Answer**: Water expands when cooled from **4°C to 0°C** instead of contracting.

Example: **Mercury droplets spherical**.\n **Adhesion**: Attraction between different molecules. Example: **Water wets glass**.\n (c) Ways:\n - Increase depth (h)\n - Use denser liquid (ρ)\n\n32. **Full Answer**:\n (a) Check zero error. Place slide between jaws, close gently. Read main scale + vernier scale coincidence × 0.01 cm for thickness.\n (b) Mass of water = **78 g - 28 g = 50 g**\n Volume = **50 cm³**\n Mass of oil = **68 g - 28 g = 40 g**\n Density of oil = **40 / 50 = 0.8 g/cm³ = 800 kg/m³**\n (c) Types:\n - **Systematic error** (e.g., zero error)\n - **Random error** (e.g., parallax)\n - **Gross error** (e.g., wrong reading)\n\n33. **Full Answer**:\n (a) Pressure applied to enclosed fluid transmitted equally in all directions.\n Application: **Hydraulic jack/brakes**.\n (b) Driver presses brake pedal → small piston applies force to fluid → pressure transmitted to larger pistons at wheels → greater force applied to brake pads → stops vehicle.\n (c) Use a flat board with holes connected to air pump. Blow air → board hovers slightly above surface on air cushion → push gently with small force (almost frictionless motion compared to without air).\n\n**Grand Total: 100 marks**"
