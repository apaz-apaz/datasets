(a) Biology is the study of living organisms, their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution.\n\n (b) Branches: Botany (study of plants), Zoology (study of animals), Microbiology (study of microorganisms), Ecology (study of interactions between organisms and environment), Genetics (study of heredity). For example, Ecology helps understand how pollution affects wildlife, aiding conservation efforts.\n\n4. (a) First aid is immediate care given to an injured or ill person before professional medical help arrives, to prevent worsening or save life.\n\n (b) For snake bite: Keep calm, immobilize the limb, apply pressure bandage if not venomous, seek medical help immediately. Do not cut or suck the wound, as it can spread venom.\n\n5. (a) Immunization introduces weakened pathogens to stimulate antibody production, providing immunity against diseases without causing illness.\n\n (b) Polio, Measles, Tuberculosis (TB). Vaccines like OPV for polio prevent paralysis.\n\n6. (a) [Diagram: Animal cell with labels - cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, ribosomes, etc.]\n\n (b) Plant cells have cell wall, chloroplasts, large central vacuole; animal cells have centrioles, smaller vacuoles, no chloroplasts. These differences relate to their functions: plants photosynthesize, animals move more.\n\n7. (a) Classification is grouping organisms based on shared characteristics for easy study and identification.\n\n (b) Monera (e.g., Bacteria), Protoctista (e.g., Amoeba), Fungi (e.g., Mushroom), Plantae (e.g., Maize), Animalia (e.g., Human). This system, by Linnaeus, uses binomial nomenclature like Homo sapiens.\n\n8. (a) Nutrition is the process of obtaining and using food for growth, repair, and energy.\n\n (b) Autotrophic: Organisms make own food (e.g., plants via photosynthesis). Heterotrophic: Depend on others (e.g., animals eating plants/animals). This distinction shows energy flow in ecosystems.\n\n9. (a) Gaseous exchange is the diffusion of gases (O₂ in, CO₂ out) across a moist surface.\n\n (b) In humans, air enters via nose/mouth, to trachea, bronchi, alveoli where O₂ diffuses into blood, CO₂ out. Respiration: Inhalation (diaphragm contracts, volume increases), exhalation (relaxes, volume decreases). This maintains oxygen for cellular respiration: glucose + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O + energy.\n\n10. Transport moves substances like water, nutrients, gases, wastes within organisms. In plants: Xylem transports water/minerals from roots (via osmosis/transpiration pull), phloem transports food from leaves. Importance: Distributes nutrients for growth, removes wastes. In animals: Blood carries O₂ from lungs, nutrients from intestines, hormones; removes CO₂ to lungs, urea to kidneys. Importance: Supplies cells with essentials, maintains homeostasis. Without transport, multicellular organisms couldn't function as cells far from sources would die.\n\nNote: This is a sample based on the official NECTA FTNA Biology format from 2022 (latest available, no changes noted for 2025).
