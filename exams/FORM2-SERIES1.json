(5 marks)\n **Answer**:\n Density = mass / volume = **2 kg / 0.0004 m³ = 5000 kg/m³**\n Relative density = **5000 / 1000 = 5**\n\n25. (3 marks)\n **Answer**: The weight of a floating body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body.\n\n26. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Pressure in a liquid increases with depth (P = ρgh). At the base, the depth is greatest, so pressure is maximum. Thicker walls are needed to withstand this high pressure.\n\n27. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Pressure is the force acting per unit area.\n SI unit: **Pascal (Pa)** or **N/m²**.\n\n28. (5 marks)\n **Answer**:\n Upthrust = 10 N - 7 N = **3 N**\n Volume = **400 cm³ = 0.0004 m³**\n Mass of liquid displaced = upthrust / g = **3 / 10 = 0.3 kg**\n Density of liquid = **0.3 / 0.0004 = 750 kg/m³**\n\n29. (3 marks)\n **Answers**:\n - Water droplets forming spherical shapes\n - Insects walking on water surface\n - Rise of ink in a pen nib\n (Any three relevant)\n\n30. (4 marks)\n **Answer**: Capillarity is the rise or fall of a liquid in a narrow tube due to surface tension.\n Example of rise: **Water rises in a glass capillary tube** (adhesion > cohesion).\n Example of depression: **Mercury falls in a glass capillary tube** (cohesion > adhesion).\n\n**Subtotal: 40 marks**\n\n### Section C: Structured/Essay Questions (40 Marks)\n(Answer any two – 20 marks each)\n\n31. **Full Answer**:\n (a) **Solids**: Particles are tightly packed, vibrate in fixed positions, strong intermolecular forces → definite shape and volume.\n **Liquids**: Particles are close but can slide past each other, weaker forces → definite volume, no fixed shape.\n **Gases**: Particles are far apart, move rapidly and randomly, very weak forces → no definite shape or volume, fill the container.\n (b) **Cohesion**: Attraction between molecules of the same substance. Example: **Mercury forms spherical drops**.\n **Adhesion**: Attraction between molecules of different substances. Example: **Water wets glass** forming a concave meniscus.\n (c) Effects:\n - **Water striders walk on water** due to surface tension.\n - **Capillary action** in plants allows water to rise through xylem.\n\n32. **Full Answer**:\n (a) Measure the mass of the irregular object using a balance. Fill a measuring cylinder with water and record the initial volume. Submerge the object fully in the water and record the new volume. The difference in volume is the object’s volume. Calculate density using **density = mass / volume**.\n (b) Mass of water = **100 g - 50 g = 50 g**\n Volume of bottle = **50 cm³** (since density of water = 1 g/cm³)\n Mass of liquid = **95 g - 50 g = 45 g**\n Relative density = **45 / 50 = 0.9**\n (c) Precautions:\n - Ensure the vernier caliper is free of zero error.\n - Place the object firmly between the jaws without excessive force.\n - Read the scale at eye level to avoid parallax error.\n\n33. **Full Answer**:\n (a) A body floats in a fluid if the weight of the fluid displaced equals the weight of the body.\n (b) A hydrometer floats in a liquid. It sinks until the weight of the liquid displaced equals its own weight. The stem is narrow, so small changes in density cause large changes in the depth of sinking. The scale on the stem is calibrated to read the density directly.\n (c) Suspend a meter rule at its midpoint (pivot). Hang a known weight (e.g., 100 g) at a distance (e.g., 20 cm) from the pivot on one side. Hang another weight on the opposite side and adjust its position until the rule balances horizontally. Record the weight and distance. Verify that the clockwise moment (weight × distance) equals the anticlockwise moment.\n\n**Grand Total: 100 marks**"
