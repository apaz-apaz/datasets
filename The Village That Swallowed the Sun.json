      "content": "In the dry land of Dodoma there was a small village called Jua Kali.\n\nEvery morning the sun rose right above their roofs like a big golden coin.\n\nChildren played in its light. Goats danced in its warmth.\n\nOne Tuesday, the sun did not rise.\n\nIt simply slipped lower and lower… until it fell straight into the village well with a loud PLOPP! 💦\n\nThe sky turned purple. The air became cold. Everyone ran outside shouting."

      "content": "The village elders brought torches and looked into the old stone well.\n\nThere, at the bottom, sat the sun.\n\nIt looked small and sad, like a lost orange ball.\n\nAn old woman asked, “Sun, why did you fall?”\n\nThe sun answered in a tiny voice:\n\n“You never say thank you anymore. I got tired of shining for free.”\n\n![Tiny sun sitting inside dark well](https://picsum.photos/seed/sun-inside-well/800/600)"

      "content": "Without the sun the village became ice.\n\nWater turned hard. Breath became smoke.\n\nGoats wore blankets. Chickens refused to lay eggs.\n\nChildren cried because their fingers hurt.\n\nThe chief promised, “We will bring the sun back!”\n\n![Village wrapped in blankets under purple sky](https://picsum.photos/seed/cold-village-blankets/800/600)"

      "content": "Every day the villagers lowered gifts into the well:\n\n- Fresh milk in a calabash 🥛\n- Sweet bananas 🍌🍌\n- A song from the school choir 🎶\n- A love letter from little Neema 💌\n\nThe sun ate, listened, and read… but stayed at the bottom.\n\nIt said, “I want something bigger.”"

      "chapter_title": "Neema’s Brave Idea 💡",
      "content": "Neema was only eight years old, but she was not scared.\n\nShe tied a rope around her waist and asked the strongest men to lower her down.\n\nDown, down, down she went until her feet touched warm light.\n\nShe sat beside the sun and said,\n\n“We are sorry. We forgot to say thank you. Please come home.”\n\n![Little girl sitting next to tiny sun in well](https://picsum.photos/seed/neema-sun-well/800/600)"

      "content": "The sun looked at Neema’s honest eyes.\n\nIt grew bigger and bigger until the well could not hold it.\n\nWHOOOOSH! It shot up into the sky like a rocket!\n\nHeat returned. Flowers opened. Goats started dancing again.\n\nThe whole village cheered and clapped.\n\n![Sun flying back to sky with smiling village](https://picsum.photos/seed/sun-return-sky/800/600)"
