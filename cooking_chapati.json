Sprinkle a little dry flour\n6. Cut a radius from centre to edge → roll into tight cone → press cone into spiral ball\n7. Flatten slightly → rest the spiral balls 10–15 minutes (covered)\n\nAlternative easy method (for beginners):\nRoll → brush oil → fold like a fan → roll into coil → flatten\n\nhttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1623428454735-7e7d2ee8d9b3?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80\n*Spiral coil technique for maximum layers*"

Keep rolled chapati covered with cloth so they don’t dry\n\nPro tip: Use a round lid or plate to cut perfect circles if you want hotel-style shape!"

Remove → brush lightly with oil/ghee → crush slightly between palms (this separates layers)\n7. Wrap in clean cloth to keep soft\n\nhttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596797038530-2f3729b3c0bf?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80\n*Fresh soft-layered chapati straight from the tawa*"
