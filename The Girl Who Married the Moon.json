She was fifteen years old, quiet, and loved the moon more than anything.\n\nEvery night she walked to the beach and talked to the moon like it was her best friend.\n\nOne night the moon answered back.\n\n![Girl standing on beach looking at huge moon](https://picsum.photos/seed/asha-moon-beach/800/600)"
