    "content": "SECTION A\n\n1. Multiple choice answers (with explanations)\n\n(i) B. Joule — Energy is measured in joules (J), which is the work done when a force of one newton moves an object 1 meter in the direction of the force.\n\n(ii) B. Friction — Friction is the resistive force that opposes relative motion between two surfaces in contact.\n\n(iii) A. Virtual and erect — A concave lens always produces an image that is upright (erect) and cannot be projected on a screen (virtual).\n\n(iv) A. Evaporation — Evaporation is the process by which liquid changes to vapour at temperatures below its boiling point.\n\n(v) B. Voltmeter — A voltmeter measures the potential difference between two points and must be connected in parallel.\n\n(vi) B. Velocity — The slope of a distance-time graph gives the speed or velocity of an object. Slope = rise/run = Δdistance/Δtime.\n\n(vii) A. 10 kg·m/s — Momentum, p = mass × velocity. p = 2 × 5 = 10 kg·m/s.\n\n(viii) A. Diffraction — Diffraction is the bending of waves (light, sound, etc.) around obstacles or through openings.\n\n(ix) A. P = VI — Electric power is the product of potential difference and current.\n\n(x) A. Time period — Frequency f = 1/T, where T is the time period.\n\n2. Matching\n\n(i) C; (ii) D; (iii) B; (iv) A; (v) E\n\nExplanations:\n- Boyle’s law (C): At constant temperature, pressure × volume = constant.\n- Archimedes’ principle (D): Buoyant force = weight of fluid displaced.\n- Ohm’s law (B): Current is proportional to voltage / resistance.\n- Newton’s third law (A): Action–reaction; every action has equal and opposite reaction.\n- Law of reflection (E): Angle of incidence = angle of reflection.\n\n3. Work and power\n\n(a) Definition: Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. P = W/t, units = watt (W).\n\n(b) Calculation: W = 2000 J, t = 40 s.\n- P = W/t = 2000/40 = 50 W.\n\nExplanation: Power indicates how fast work is done.\n\n4. Newton’s first law and application\n\n(a) Statement: An object will remain at rest or continue to move at constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.\n\n(b) Calculation: F = 10 N, m = 0.5 kg.\n- a = F/m = 10/0.5 = 20 m/s².\n\nExplanation: Acceleration is proportional to net force and inversely proportional to mass.\n\n5. Latent heat of fusion\n\n(a) Definition: Latent heat of fusion is the heat energy required to change 1 kg of a solid into liquid at constant temperature.\n\n(b) Calculation: Q = m × Lf = 0.2 × 3.4 × 10^5 = 68000 J.\n\nExplanation: No temperature change occurs during the phase change; energy is used to break molecular bonds.\n\n6. Electric circuit and safety\n\n(a) Diagram description: Battery (cell) connected to resistor R; ammeter A in series; switch S; wires connecting all components. Labels clearly shown.\n\n(b) Safety precautions:\n- Switch off power before adjusting circuit.\n- Avoid touching live wires and use components rated for current.\n\nSECTION B\n\n7. Speed vs velocity\n\nExplanation: \n- Speed is a scalar quantity, giving magnitude only; average speed = total distance / total time.\n- Velocity is a vector quantity, giving both magnitude and direction; average velocity = displacement / time.\n- Example: If a car moves 100 m east in 10 s, speed = 10 m/s, velocity = 10 m/s east.\n\n8. Density and floating\n\n(a) Calculation:\n- Volume V = 0.1³ = 0.001 m³\n- Mass m = 2 kg\n- Density ρ = m/V = 2 / 0.001 = 2000 kg/m³\n- Since ρ > 1000 kg/m³, cube is denser than water → sinks.\n\n(b) Fraction submerged: Not applicable (sinks entirely).\n\nExplanation: Floating occurs if object density < fluid density; otherwise, it sinks.\n\n9. Efficiency\n\n(a) Definition: Efficiency = (useful energy output / total energy input) × 100%.\n\n(b) Calculation: useful = 4000 J, input = 5000 J\n- Efficiency = (4000/5000) × 100% = 80%.\n\nExplanation: 20% of energy lost as heat, friction, etc.\n\n10. Convex lens real image\n\n(a) Description: Object beyond 2F forms a real, inverted, and diminished image between F and 2F on the opposite side. Real image can be projected on screen.\n\n(b) Ray diagram description: Principal axis, convex lens, F points marked. Ray 1: parallel to axis, refracted through far focal point. Ray 2: through centre of lens, straight. Intersection of rays on opposite side forms real image.\n\nSECTION C\n\n11. Simple pendulum experiment\n\n(a) Steps:\n1. Suspend a small dense bob from a string of known length L.\n2. Pull bob to small angle and release; start timing.\n3. Measure time for multiple oscillations to reduce error.\n4. Calculate period T = total time / number of oscillations.\n5. Use formula g = 4π²L/T² to determine acceleration due to gravity.\n\n(b) Calculation: L = 1 m, T = 2 s\n- g = 4π² × 1 / 2² = 4π² / 4 ≈ 9.87 ≈ 10 m/s²\n\n(c) Precautions:\n- Small oscillation angle (<15°) to ensure simple harmonic motion.\n- Measure length L accurately from pivot to centre of mass of bob.\n- Use precise timing instruments; repeat measurements to get average.\n\nExplanation: These precautions minimize errors from amplitude, measurement, and reaction time.\n\nTEACHER NOTES\n\n- Ensure students show units at every step.\n- Draw labelled diagrams for all optics and circuits questions.\n- Method marks should be awarded even if final numerical answers have minor arithmetic mistakes.\n\nEnd of Answers."
