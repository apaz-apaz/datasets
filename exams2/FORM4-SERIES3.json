(a) Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. Three states: solid, liquid, gas.\n(b) Examples: Solid — iron; Liquid — water; Gas — oxygen.\n\n4. (a) Ionic bonding: In NaCl, sodium atom loses one electron to chlorine atom. Na becomes Na+ and Cl becomes Cl−; the opposite charges attract forming ionic bond.\n(b) Lewis diagram for H2O: O has 6 valence electrons (dots) and shares one electron with each H forming two covalent bonds.\n\n5. (a) Avogadro’s law: At constant temperature and pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles.\n(b) If number of moles doubles, volume doubles: 10 L × 2 = 20 L.\n\n6. (a) Brønsted–Lowry acid: proton donor; base: proton acceptor.\n(b) pH = -log[H+] = -log(1 × 10^-4) = 4.\n\n7.

(a) Law: mass of reactants = mass of products.\n(b) 2 g H2 + 16 g O2 → 18 g H2O; mass before = 18 g, after = 18 g (conserved).\n\n9. (a) Oxidation number: hypothetical charge if electrons were fully transferred.\n(b) In H2SO4: H = +1 × 2 = +2; O = -2 × 4 = -8; let S = x: x +2 -8 = 0 → x = +6.\n\n10. (a) Electrolysis of molten NaCl: Na+ ions go to cathode, gain electrons to form Na; Cl− ions go to anode, lose electrons to form Cl2 gas.\n(b) Products: cathode — molten sodium; anode — chlorine gas.\n\nSECTION C\n\n11. (a) To prepare 500 cm³ of 1.0 M NaOH: Calculate moles needed: M × V = 1 × 0.5 = 0.5 mol. Mass = 0.5 × 40 = 20 g NaOH; dissolve in water and make up to 500 cm³.\n(b) Safety: wear goggles and gloves; add NaOH to water slowly; label container.\n\n12.
