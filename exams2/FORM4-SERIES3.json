    "content": "SECTION A\n\n1. Multiple choice answers (with explanation)\n\n(i) B. Chlorine — Chlorine is a halogen, group 17 element.\n(ii) C. Molar mass — Mass of one mole of an element or compound.\n(iii) B. Displacement — Zinc displaces hydrogen from HCl.\n(iv) B. Carbon dioxide — Carbonate + acid produces CO2.\n(v) A. MgSO4 — Magnesium sulfate has one Mg²⁺ and one SO4²⁻.\n(vi) A. 1s2 2s2 2p4 — Oxygen has 8 electrons.\n(vii) B. Sharing of electrons — Covalent bond involves sharing.\n(viii) B. HCl — Strong acid fully dissociates in water.\n(ix) B. It is polar — Water’s polarity allows it to dissolve many substances.\n(x) B. Zn + CuSO4 → ZnSO4 + Cu — Zn is oxidized, Cu²⁺ reduced; redox reaction.\n\n2. Matching\n\n(i) B; (ii) C; (iii) D; (iv) E; (v) A\n\nExplanation:\n- Solubility: ability to dissolve.\n- Volatility: tendency to vaporize.\n- Catalyst: speeds up reaction.\n- Electrolysis: decomposition by electricity.\n- Relative molecular mass: mass compared to 1/12 of carbon-12.\n\nSECTION B\n\n3. Isotopes\n\n(a) Isotopes: atoms of the same element with same number of protons but different neutrons. Example: 12C, 13C.\n(b) RAM = (75 × 35 + 25 × 37)/100 = (2625 + 925)/100 = 3550/100 = 35.5.\n\n4. Ionic vs covalent compounds\n\n(a) Ionic: formed by transfer of electrons, metal + non-metal.\n    Covalent: formed by sharing of electrons, non-metal + non-metal.\n(b) Dot and cross NH3: N has 5 valence electrons (dots), each H shares 1 electron (cross) → 3 N–H bonds, 1 lone pair on N.\n\n5. Mole concept\n\n(a) Molarity = moles of solute / volume of solution (L). Mole fraction = moles of component / total moles.\n(b) Number of moles = mass / molar mass = 18 / 18 = 1 mole.\n\n6. Acids and bases\n\n(a) Brønsted-Lowry: Acid = proton donor, Base = proton acceptor.\n(b) [H+] = Kw / [OH-] = 1 × 10^-14 / 1 × 10^-3 = 1 × 10^-11 → pH = -log[H+] = 11.\n\n7. Solubility\n\n(a) Factors: temperature, pressure (for gases), nature of solute and solvent.\n(b) Mass % = (mass solute / total mass solution) × 100 = (20 / (20 + 100)) × 100 = 16.67%.\n\n8. Oxidation and reduction\n\n(a) Oxidation: loss of electrons (Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻). Reduction: gain of electrons (Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu).\n(b) Cr in K2Cr2O7: Let x = oxidation number of Cr. 2K⁺ (+1) + 2Cr + 7O²⁻ (-14) = 0 → 2 + 2x -14 = 0 → 2x = 12 → x = +6.\n\n9. Electrolysis of aqueous CuSO4\n\n(a) Cathode: Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu (deposited). Anode: Cu → Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻.\n(b) Cathode: copper metal, Anode: copper ions into solution.\n\n10. Preparation of 1 M HCl\n\n(a) Dilution formula: C1V1 = C2V2 → 12 × V1 = 1 × 0.25 → V1 = 0.02083 L ≈ 20.8 cm³. Measure 20.8 cm³ concentrated HCl, dilute to 250 cm³ with water.\n(b) Precautions: wear gloves/goggles; add acid to water slowly.\n\nSECTION C\n\n11. Standardization of NaOH\n\n(a) Steps: weigh known mass of oxalic acid, dissolve in water, fill burette with NaOH, titrate until phenolphthalein changes colour.\n(b) Reaction: H2C2O4 + 2NaOH → Na2C2O4 + 2H2O.\n(c) Calculate concentration: moles oxalic acid reacted = mass / molar mass, use stoichiometry to find moles NaOH, then divide by volume used to get molarity.\nExplanation: Titre readings give volume of NaOH needed to neutralize known moles of acid."
