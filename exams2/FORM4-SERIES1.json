(take lowest power present in both -> 2^1 or 2^2?).\n\nCarefully compare powers:\n- For prime 2: powers are 2^2 (in 84) and 2^1 (in 126) → take 2^1.\n- For prime 3: powers are 3^1 (in 84) and 3^2 (in 126) → take 3^1.\n- For prime 7: both have 7^1 → take 7^1.\n\nHCF = 2^1 × 3^1 × 7^1 = 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nNumber: 0.000456.\n\nTo write in standard form move decimal point 4 places right: 4.56 × 10^{-4}.\n\nAnswer: 4.56 × 10^{-4}.\n\n\n\n2. (a)\n\n1 kilometre = 1000 metres.\n\n4.2 km = 4.2 × 1000 = 4200 m.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nNumber: 63,849.\n\nSignificant figures: take first three non-zero digits: 6, 3, 8 → gives 6.38 × 10^4.\n\nCheck next digit (4) < 5 → no rounding up.\n\nSo rounded value = 63,800.\n\n\n\n3. (a)\n\n4x - 9 = 3x + 7.\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides: x - 9 = 7.\n\nAdd 9: x = 16.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nx^2 - 5x - 14.\n\nFind two numbers whose product = −14 and sum = −5 → −7 and +2.\n\nThus factorization: (x - 7)(x + 2).\n\n\n\n4. (a)\n\nAngles in triangle sum to 180°.\n\nC = 180° − (A + B) = 180° − (35° + 65°) = 180° − 100° = 80°.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nArea = 1/2 × base × height = 1/2 × 16 × 9 = 8 × 9 = 72 cm^2.\n\n\n\n5.

Profit = 12% of 500,000 = 0.12 × 500,000 = 60,000 Tsh.\n\nSelling price = 500,000 + 60,000 = 560,000 Tsh.\n\n\n\n6. (a)\n\nGradient m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (15 - 3) / (4 - (−2)) = 12 / 6 = 2.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nUse point A(−2, 3) and m = 2.\n\ny - 3 = 2(x - (−2)) → y - 3 = 2(x + 2).\n\nExpand: y - 3 = 2x + 4 → y = 2x + 7.\n\nEquation: y = 2x + 7.\n\n\n\n7. (a)\n\n81^{3/4} = (81^{1/4})^3 or (81^{3})^{1/4} but easier: 81 = 3^4.\n\nSo 81^{3/4} = (3^4)^{3/4} = 3^{4×(3/4)} = 3^3 = 27.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nlog(x) + log(5) = log(100) → log(5x) = log(100).\n\nTherefore 5x = 100 → x = 100 / 5 = 20.\n\n\n\n8. (a)\n\nPythagoras theorem: In a right-angled triangle, (hypotenuse)^2 = (side1)^2 + (side2)^2.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nSides 9 cm and 40 cm (perpendicular sides).\n\nHypotenuse^2 = 9^2 + 40^2 = 81 + 1600 = 1681.\n\nHypotenuse = √1681 = 41 cm.\n\n\n\nSECTION B\n\n9.
