(take lowest power present in both -> 2^1 or 2^2?).\n\nCarefully compare powers:\n- For prime 2: powers are 2^2 (in 84) and 2^1 (in 126) → take 2^1.\n- For prime 3: powers are 3^1 (in 84) and 3^2 (in 126) → take 3^1.\n- For prime 7: both have 7^1 → take 7^1.\n\nHCF = 2^1 × 3^1 × 7^1 = 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nNumber: 0.000456.\n\nTo write in standard form move decimal point 4 places right: 4.56 × 10^{-4}.\n\nAnswer: 4.56 × 10^{-4}.\n\n\n\n2. (a)\n\n1 kilometre = 1000 metres.\n\n4.2 km = 4.2 × 1000 = 4200 m.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nNumber: 63,849.\n\nSignificant figures: take first three non-zero digits: 6, 3, 8 → gives 6.38 × 10^4.\n\nCheck next digit (4) < 5 → no rounding up.\n\nSo rounded value = 63,800.\n\n\n\n3. (a)\n\n4x - 9 = 3x + 7.\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides: x - 9 = 7.\n\nAdd 9: x = 16.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nx^2 - 5x - 14.\n\nFind two numbers whose product = −14 and sum = −5 → −7 and +2.\n\nThus factorization: (x - 7)(x + 2).\n\n\n\n4. (a)\n\nAngles in triangle sum to 180°.\n\nC = 180° − (A + B) = 180° − (35° + 65°) = 180° − 100° = 80°.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nArea = 1/2 × base × height = 1/2 × 16 × 9 = 8 × 9 = 72 cm^2.\n\n\n\n5. (a)\n\nRatio red:blue = 3:5. Total parts = 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nOne part = 40 ÷ 8 = 5.\n\nRed = 3 × 5 = 15. Blue = 5 × 5 = 25.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nCost price = 500,000 Tsh. Profit = 12% of 500,000 = 0.12 × 500,000 = 60,000 Tsh.\n\nSelling price = 500,000 + 60,000 = 560,000 Tsh.\n\n\n\n6. (a)\n\nGradient m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (15 - 3) / (4 - (−2)) = 12 / 6 = 2.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nUse point A(−2, 3) and m = 2.\n\ny - 3 = 2(x - (−2)) → y - 3 = 2(x + 2).\n\nExpand: y - 3 = 2x + 4 → y = 2x + 7.\n\nEquation: y = 2x + 7.\n\n\n\n7. (a)\n\n81^{3/4} = (81^{1/4})^3 or (81^{3})^{1/4} but easier: 81 = 3^4.\n\nSo 81^{3/4} = (3^4)^{3/4} = 3^{4×(3/4)} = 3^3 = 27.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nlog(x) + log(5) = log(100) → log(5x) = log(100).\n\nTherefore 5x = 100 → x = 100 / 5 = 20.\n\n\n\n8. (a)\n\nPythagoras theorem: In a right-angled triangle, (hypotenuse)^2 = (side1)^2 + (side2)^2.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nSides 9 cm and 40 cm (perpendicular sides).\n\nHypotenuse^2 = 9^2 + 40^2 = 81 + 1600 = 1681.\n\nHypotenuse = √1681 = 41 cm.\n\n\n\nSECTION B\n\n9. (a)\n\nEquation: 2x^2 - 3x - 5 = 0.\n\nUse quadratic formula x = [3 ± √( (−3)^2 - 4·2·(−5) )] / (2·2).\n\nDiscriminant Δ = (−3)^2 - 4·2·(−5) = 9 + 40 = 49.\n\nSo x = [3 ± √49] / 4 = [3 ± 7] / 4.\n\nThus x1 = (3 + 7)/4 = 10/4 = 5/2 = 2.5.\n\nx2 = (3 - 7)/4 = (−4)/4 = −1.\n\n(b) Verification:\n\nFor x = 2.5: 2(2.5)^2 - 3(2.5) - 5 = 2(6.25) - 7.5 - 5 = 12.5 - 12.5 = 0 ✓.\n\nFor x = −1: 2(1) - 3(−1) - 5 = 2 + 3 - 5 = 0 ✓.\n\n\n\n10.\n\nRight triangle situation: distance from foot = 30 m, angle of elevation = 37°.\n\nHeight h = 30 × tan 37°.\n\nCompute: tan 37° ≈ 0.75355405 (use table/calculator),\n\nh ≈ 30 × 0.75355405 ≈ 22.6066215 m.\n\nRounded to 2 d.p: h ≈ 22.61 m.\n\n(Show working: h = 30 tan 37° → substitution → evaluation → rounding.)\n\n\n\n11.\n\nBag composition: 3 red, 4 blue, 5 green → total 12 beads.\n\nWe draw one bead (not replaced), then another.\n\nProbability(first is red and second is blue) = P(first red) × P(second blue | first red).\n\nP(first red) = 3/12 = 1/4.\n\nAfter removing one red, remaining beads = 11; blues still = 4.\n\nSo P(second blue | first red) = 4/11.\n\nTherefore probability = (1/4) × (4/11) = 1/11.\n\nAs decimal: 1/11 ≈ 0.090909... ≈ 0.091 (to 3 d.p.).\n\nAnswer: 1/11 and 0.091.\n\n\n\n12.\n\nSide ratio = 4 : 7.\n\nArea ratio = (side ratio)^2 = 4^2 : 7^2 = 16 : 49.\n\nLet area of larger triangle = 245 cm^2 correspond to 49 parts.\n\nOne part = 245 ÷ 49 = 5 cm^2.\n\nSmaller triangle area = 16 × 5 = 80 cm^2.\n\n\n\n13.\n\nDistance formula between P(−3, 4) and Q(5, −2):\n\nDistance = √[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2] = √[(5 - (−3))^2 + (−2 - 4)^2]\n\n= √[(8)^2 + (−6)^2] = √(64 + 36) = √100 = 10 units.\n\n\n\n14.\n\nSystem:\n3x + 2y = 16  ...(1)\nx - y = 2    ...(2)\n\nFrom (2): x = y + 2.\n\nSubstitute into (1): 3(y + 2) + 2y = 16.\n\n3y + 6 + 2y = 16 → 5y + 6 = 16.\n\n5y = 10 → y = 2.\n\nThen x = y + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nSolution: x = 4, y = 2."
