(a)\n\nPrime factors of 48 = 2×2×2×2×3.\nPrime factors of 80 = 2×2×2×2×5.\n\nCommon factors = 2×2×2×2 = 16 ⇒ HCF = 16.\nLCM = (48×80) / HCF = (3840) / 16 = 240.\n\nExplanation: HCF = highest common factor; LCM = least common multiple.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n0.000324 = move decimal 4 places = 3.24 × 10^{-4}.\n\n\n\n2.
