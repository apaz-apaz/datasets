    "content": "SECTION A\n1. Multiple Choice Answers\n(i) B. Pascal — Pressure = force/area; SI unit = Pa.\n(ii) B. Mass × velocity — Momentum = p = m v.\n(iii) B. Virtual, erect image — Convex mirror always forms virtual, erect, diminished image.\n(iv) A. Vapor pressure = atmospheric pressure — Boiling occurs when vapor pressure equals surrounding pressure.\n(v) A. V ∝ I — Ohm's law: V = IR when R constant.\n(vi) A. Coulomb — Electric charge unit.\n(vii) B. Force ∝ displacement opposite direction — Simple harmonic motion.\n(viii) A. Bending of light at boundary — Refraction.\n\n2. Matching\n(i) D; (ii) C; (iii) A; (iv) B; (v) E\n\nSECTION B\n3. Power\nP = work / time = 200 / 5 = 40 W\n\n4. Newton’s 1st Law\nA body remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by net force. Example: Book stays on table until pushed.\n\n5. Latent heat of fusion\nDefinition: Heat to change 1 kg of solid to liquid without temperature change.\nQ = m Lf = 0.5 × 3.36 ×10^5 = 1.68 × 10^5 J\n\n6. Parallel circuit: battery connected to two resistors in parallel with switch; safety: switch off before connecting, avoid touching live wires.\n\n7. Upthrust\nDepends on density of fluid and volume displaced.\n- Volume block = 0.01 m³, mass = 15 kg\n- Weight = 15 ×10 = 150 N\n- Upthrust = ρ V g = 1000 ×0.01 ×10 = 100 N → Weight > Upthrust → sinks\n\n8. Efficiency\nη = 1200 /1500 ×100% = 80%\n\n9. Series vs Parallel\nSeries: resistances add, current same; Parallel: 1/R_total = 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/10 = 0.25+0.2+0.1=0.55 → R_total ≈ 1.818 Ω\nTotal current I = V/R_total = 20 / 1.818 ≈ 11 A\n\n10. Concave lens\nForms virtual, erect, diminished image on same side as object; diagram shows rays diverging through lens, extended backward to meet at virtual image.\n\nSECTION C\n11. Concave mirror experiment\n(a) Place mirror, screen; point at distant object; move screen to get sharp image; measure distance = focal length.\n(b) Measured distance = 18 cm → f ≈ 18 cm\n(c) Object at 2F: image real, inverted, same size, located at 2F on opposite side."
