(take lowest power present in both -> 2^1 or 2^2?).\n\nCarefully compare powers:\n- For prime 2: powers are 2^2 (in 84) and 2^1 (in 126) → take 2^1.\n- For prime 3: powers are 3^1 (in 84) and 3^2 (in 126) → take 3^1.\n- For prime 7: both have 7^1 → take 7^1.\n\nHCF = 2^1 × 3^1 × 7^1 = 2 × 3 × 7 = 42.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nNumber: 0.000456.\n\nTo write in standard form move decimal point 4 places right: 4.56 × 10^{-4}.\n\nAnswer: 4.56 × 10^{-4}.\n\n\n\n2.

(a)\n\n81^{3/4} = (81^{1/4})^3 or (81^{3})^{1/4} but easier: 81 = 3^4.\n\nSo 81^{3/4} = (3^4)^{3/4} = 3^{4×(3/4)} = 3^3 = 27.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nlog(x) + log(5) = log(100) → log(5x) = log(100).\n\nTherefore 5x = 100 → x = 100 / 5 = 20.\n\n\n\n8. (a)\n\nPythagoras theorem: In a right-angled triangle, (hypotenuse)^2 = (side1)^2 + (side2)^2.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nSides 9 cm and 40 cm (perpendicular sides).\n\nHypotenuse^2 = 9^2 + 40^2 = 81 + 1600 = 1681.\n\nHypotenuse = √1681 = 41 cm.\n\n\n\nSECTION B\n\n9.

    "content": "SECTION A\n\n1. (a)\n\nSI base unit of mass is the kilogram.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nSymbol: kg.\n\n\n\n2. (a)\n\nDensity is defined as mass per unit volume of a substance; mathematically density ρ = mass/volume.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nGiven mass m = 0.5 kg and volume V = 2.5 × 10^{-4} m^3.\n\nDensity ρ = m / V = 0.5 ÷ (2.5 × 10^{-4}).\n\nCompute: 0.5 ÷ 2.5 = 0.2, and divide by 10^{-4} gives 0.2 × 10^{4} = 2.0 × 10^{3} kg/m^3.\n\nSo ρ = 2000 kg/m^3.\n\n(ʻWhyʼ: we divide mass by the small volume to obtain a large density.)\n\n\n\n3. (a)\n\nUniform motion means motion with constant velocity (both constant speed and constant direction); acceleration is zero.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nSpeed = 72 km/h. Convert km/h to m/s: multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 h): factor = 1000/3600 = 5/18.\n\nSo v = 72 × (5/18) m/s = 72 × 0.277777... = 20 m/s.\n\n(ʻWhyʼ: 72 km/h = (72 × 1000) / 3600 = 20 m/s.)\n\n\n\n4. (a)\n\nNewton's second law: The net force acting on a body is equal to the rate of change of its momentum. For constant mass this becomes F = ma (force equals mass times acceleration).\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nGiven F = 20 N, a = 2 m/s^2. From F = ma, mass m = F / a = 20 / 2 = 10 kg.\n\n(ʻWhyʼ: rearrange F = ma to m = F/a.)\n\n\n\n5. (a)\n\nElectric current is the rate of flow of electric charge; I = Q / t where Q is charge and t is time.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nGiven charge Q = 30 C, time t = 5 s. Current I = Q / t = 30 / 5 = 6 A.\n\n(ʻWhyʼ: 6 coulombs per second pass the point.)\n\n\n\n6. (a)\n\nLaw of reflection: The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection; both angles are measured from the normal to the reflecting surface.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nIf the incident angle to the normal is 30°, the angle of reflection = 30°.\n\n(ʻWhyʼ: by the law of reflection the two angles are equal.)\n\n\n\n7. (a)\n\nWavelength is the distance between two successive corresponding points on a wave (e.g., crest to crest) and is usually denoted by λ.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nGiven frequency f = 250 Hz and wave speed v = 500 m/s. Relationship v = f λ.\n\nSo λ = v / f = 500 / 250 = 2.0 m.\n\n(ʻWhyʼ: wave speed divided by frequency gives distance per cycle.)\n\n\n\n8. (a)\n\nAn elastic collision is one in which kinetic energy is conserved as well as momentum (e.g., collision between two hard steel balls under ideal conditions).\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nFor two equal masses where one is moving and the other is at rest, in a one-dimensional perfectly elastic head-on collision the moving mass stops and the stationary mass moves off with the original velocity of the first mass.\n\n(ʻWhyʼ: momentum and kinetic energy conservation lead to exchange of velocities for equal masses.)\n\n\n\nSECTION B\n\n9. (a)\n\nGiven: mass m = 0.2 kg, spring constant k = 200 N/m, displacement x_{max} = 0.05 m.\n\nHooke's law gives restoring force F = -kx. Maximum acceleration occurs at maximum displacement where acceleration magnitude a_{max} = F_max / m = (k x_{max}) / m.\n\nCompute: k x_{max} = 200 × 0.05 = 10 N.\n\nSo a_{max} = 10 / 0.2 = 50 m/s^2.\n\n(ʻWhyʼ: when spring is maximally stretched/compressed the restoring force is greatest and thus acceleration is greatest.)\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nEnergy transformations: At maximum displacement, energy is stored as elastic potential energy in the spring (1/2 k x^2). As the mass passes through equilibrium, the elastic potential energy is converted to kinetic energy (1/2 m v^2). Thus energy oscillates between elastic potential and kinetic energy (neglecting friction).\n\n\n\n10. (a)\n\nA simple electric cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy via chemical reactions at its electrodes which produce a potential difference (emf) between the terminals; this drives charges through an external circuit.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nGiven resistor R = 10 Ω, battery V = 12 V.\n\nCurrent I = V / R = 12 / 10 = 1.2 A.\n\nPower dissipated P = V × I = 12 × 1.2 = 14.4 W. Alternatively P = I^2 R = (1.2)^2 × 10 = 1.44 × 10 = 14.4 W.\n\n(ʻWhyʼ: Ohm's law and power formulas.)\n\n\n\n11. (a)\n\nExperiment to determine density of an irregular solid:\n\nSteps:\n1. Measure mass m of the solid using a balance; record m.\n2. Fill a measuring cylinder with water to a convenient initial volume V_i; record V_i.\n3. Carefully immerse the irregular solid completely in the water; record the new volume V_f.\n4. Volume of solid V = V_f - V_i (displaced volume).\n5. Compute density ρ = m / V.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nSources of error and minimization:\n- Parallax error when reading volumes: minimize by reading at eye level with the meniscus.\n- Air bubbles clinging to the solid increase measured displaced volume: remove bubbles by gently tapping or wetting the solid first.\n- Temperature changes affect water density: perform at room temperature and use same fluid consistency.\n- Balance zero error: calibrate/tare the balance before measurement.\n\n(ʻWhyʼ: accurate volume and mass measurements are crucial for correct density.)\n\n\n\nSECTION C (Answer any TWO)\n\n12. (a)\n\nDerivation of v^2 = u^2 + 2as using SUVAT equations:\n\nStart with v = u + at  ...(1)\n\nAlso s = ut + 1/2 a t^2 ...(2)\n\nSolve (1) for t: t = (v - u) / a.\n\nSubstitute into (2): s = u[(v - u)/a] + 1/2 a [(v - u)^2 / a^2].\n\nSimplify: s = (u(v - u))/a + (1/2) [(v - u)^2 / a].\n\nMultiply both sides by 2a: 2as = 2u(v - u) + (v - u)^2.\n\nExpand RHS: 2uv - 2u^2 + v^2 - 2uv + u^2 = v^2 - u^2.\n\nThus 2as = v^2 - u^2 → v^2 = u^2 + 2as.  \n\n(ʻWhyʼ: eliminate time to relate velocity, acceleration and displacement.)\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nGiven initial speed u = 0 (from rest), final speed v = 20 m/s, time t = 5 s.\n\nAcceleration a = (v - u)/t = 20 / 5 = 4 m/s^2.\n\nDistance s using s = ut + 1/2 a t^2 = 0 + 1/2 × 4 × 5^2 = 2 × 25 = 50 m.\n\nSo a = 4 m/s^2 and s = 50 m.\n\n\n\n13. (a)\n\nRay-tracing experiment for converging lens (object beyond 2F):\n\nSetup and procedure:\n1. Place a converging lens on a lens holder on an optical bench.\n2. Mark the principal axis and locate the focal points F on both sides; mark 2F positions.\n3. Place an object (arrow) beyond 2F on the axis and draw/observe three rays from the top of the object:\n   - Ray 1: parallel to axis → after lens passes through focal point on the other side.\n   - Ray 2: through centre of lens → continues straight without deviation.\n   - Ray 3: through focal point on object side → emerges parallel to axis after lens.\n4. The intersection of the refracted rays on the other side gives the top of the image.\n5. Measure image distance and image size; confirm that image is real, inverted and smaller than object (when object beyond 2F).\n\n(Include labeled diagram showing lens, F, 2F, object, rays and image.)\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nUses of converging lenses:\n- In magnifying glasses (when object is within focal length).  \n- In camera lenses to form real images on film/sensor.  \n- In the eye (natural converging lens) and in corrective lenses for farsightedness.\n\n\n\n14. (a)\n\nGiven: when V = 4.0 V, current I = 2.0 A. The V–I plot (Voltage on vertical axis, Current on horizontal axis) is a straight line through the origin (for an ohmic conductor) since V ∝ I. This verifies Ohm's law: V = IR.\n\nFrom data R = V / I = 4.0 / 2.0 = 2.0 Ω.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nGiven: resistance R = 3.0 Ω, length L = 1.5 m, area A = 0.50 mm^2 = 0.50 × 10^{-6} m^2 (since 1 mm^2 = 10^{-6} m^2).\n\nResistivity ρ is given by R = ρ L / A → ρ = R A / L.\n\nCompute: A = 0.50 × 10^{-6} m^2, so ρ = 3.0 × (0.50 × 10^{-6}) / 1.5 = (1.5 × 10^{-6}) / 1.5 = 1.0 × 10^{-6} Ω·m.\n\nSo resistivity ρ = 1.0 × 10^{-6} Ω·m.\n\n(ʻWhyʼ: convert units carefully for area before substitution.)\n\n\n\n15. (a)\n\nRadioactivity: spontaneous emission of particles or energy from unstable atomic nuclei. Three common radiations:\n- Alpha (α): helium nucleus (2 protons, 2 neutrons). Low penetrating power (stopped by paper/skin). Charged +2.\n- Beta (β): electron (β−) or positron (β+). Moderate penetrating power—stopped by a few mm of metal; charged −1 (for β−).\n- Gamma (γ): electromagnetic radiation (photons) of high energy. Very high penetrating power (requires thick lead or concrete shielding); no charge.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nGiven initial activity A_0 = 3200 decays/min at t = 0, at t = 3 min activity A = 200 decays/min.\n\nRadioactive decay follows A = A_0 e^{−λ t} where λ is decay constant.\n\nSo 200 = 3200 e^{−λ × 3} → divide both sides by 3200: 200/3200 = 1/16 = e^{−3λ}.\n\nTake natural log: ln(1/16) = −3λ → ln(1/16) = −ln(16) = −3λ.\n\nSo λ = (ln 16) / 3. Compute ln 16 = ln(2^4) = 4 ln2 ≈ 4 × 0.6931 = 2.7726.\n\nHence λ ≈ 2.7726 / 3 ≈ 0.9242 min^{-1}.\n\nHalf-life T_{1/2} = ln2 / λ ≈ 0.6931 / 0.9242 ≈ 0.75 minutes (approx).\n\n(Interpretation: this is an extremely short half-life — the sample decays very fast; note this is an approximate estimate using the two readings.)\n\n\n\n---\n\nIf ungependa, ninaweza sasa:\n1) Kuweka hii JSON kama PDF ya mtihani (na cover) kwa muundo wa kitaalamu; au\n2) Kutengeneza seti ya maswali ya mazoezi (with marking scheme) kwa kila topic ya Physics ya NECTA; au\n3) Kufanya muhtasari wa syllabus ya Physics kwa CSEE (topic-by-topic) kama checklist za kujifunzia.\n\nNikuambie unachotaka nifanye sasa, nitahakikisha niwe makini zaidi na viwango vya NECTA na format rasmi."
