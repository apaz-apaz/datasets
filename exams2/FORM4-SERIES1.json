(a)\n\nPrime factors of 84: 2 × 2 × 3 × 7.\n\nPrime factors of 126: 2 × 3 × 3 × 7.\n\nCommon prime factors are 2 × 3 × 7.\n\nHCF = 42.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nNumber given is 0.000456.\n\nMove the decimal point four places to the right.\n\nStandard form = 4.56 × 10^{-4}.\n\n\n\n2. (a)\n\n1 km = 1000 m.\n\n4.2 km = 4.2 × 1000.\n\nResult = 4200 m.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nNumber given is 63,849.\n\nFirst three significant figures are 6, 3, and 8.\n\nThe next digit is 4, which is less than 5.\n\nTherefore the number remains unchanged.\n\nResult = 63,800.\n\n\n\n3. (a)\n\nEquation: 4x − 9 = 3x + 7.\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides.\n\nx − 9 = 7.\n\nAdd 9 to both sides.\n\nx = 16.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nExpression: x² − 5x − 14.\n\nFind two numbers whose product is −14 and sum is −5.\n\nThe numbers are −7 and +2.\n\nFactorized form = (x − 7)(x + 2).\n\n\n\n4. (a)\n\nSum of angles in a triangle is 180°.\n\nAngle C = 180° − (35° + 65°).\n\nAngle C = 180° − 100° = 80°.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nArea of a triangle = 1/2 × base × height.\n\nArea = 1/2 × 16 × 9.\n\nArea = 72 cm².\n\n\n\n5. (a)\n\nRatio of red to blue balls = 3:5.\n\nTotal parts = 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nOne part = 40 ÷ 8 = 5.\n\nRed balls = 3 × 5 = 15.\n\nBlue balls = 5 × 5 = 25.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nCost price = 500,000 Tsh.\n\nProfit = 12% of 500,000.\n\nProfit = 0.12 × 500,000 = 60,000 Tsh.\n\nSelling price = 500,000 + 60,000 = 560,000 Tsh.\n\n\n\n6. (a)\n\nPoints A(−2, 3) and B(4, 15).\n\nGradient m = (15 − 3) / (4 − (−2)).\n\nGradient m = 12 / 6 = 2.\n\n\n\n(b)\n\nUsing point A(−2, 3).\n\nEquation: y − 3 = 2(x + 2).\n\nSimplifying gives y = 2x + 7.\n\n\n\n7.
