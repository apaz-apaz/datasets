Good food keeps our elders strong, happy, and independent for many more years.\n\nAfter 60, the body changes: digestion slows, muscles reduce, bones become weaker, and immunity drops. But with the right local foods eaten every day, our wazee/wakongwe can stay strong, walk without pain, remember well, and enjoy life with their grandchildren.\n\nThis guide uses only affordable foods found in every market or shamba – no special supplements or expensive items needed."
